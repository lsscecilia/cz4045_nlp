afraid something would fall over,1
not just good but great,1
sure to impress almost anyone,1

so thankful i remembered this hidden gem,1
more than accommodating when it came to scheduling my appointments and even finding a doctor for me locally for all my follow ups,1
free from glasses and contacts,1
sorry to be so blunt,1
sure one of the better kbbq,1
very generous a portion for 2 was almost enough for 3 people,1

too low for him,1
bright and welcoming,1
easy to see,1
 and out,1
unable to resolve my complaints with the technician,1
american sent out another company who diagnosed and replaced the pool pump all under warranty,1
only interested in making a quick dollar from the warranty company and not gaining a potential lifelong customer,1
so amazing,1
excited to find that they are cut thin lrb the way i like my fries rrb and crispy,1
crazy in my mouth,1
excited to have the other halves as leftovers as soon as possible,1
worth a trip,1
13 inch thick,1

wiped or clean from food being left in the counter,1
fresh and very fatty,1
pregnant so it was a bit slow at times,1
great for entertaining at home or a pot luck at work,1
a little frustrated with the service,1
fine the problem was the bartender and the server seemed to keep forgetting about it until finally my husband decided to ask for a different beer,1
more interested in talking to her coworkers than working,1
pleased with the ribs he ordered,1
a little superfluous in terms of gourmet fresh and organic,1
slow and not that good,1
pleasant for the most part from all other helpers,1
able to upgrade this,1
pretty excited because i have heard alot of hype about korean style grill places and having had the chinese style hot pot grill combinations in the past i thought maybe the grill experience would not be that different,1
distinctly korean,1
somewhat nice with a friendly accommodating waiter who suggested which daiquiris were favorites among the customers,1
nonkorean operated,1
so limited listed down on a square piece of paper that was 14 smaller than a playing card,1
really great to wrap most of the grilled meat in large lettuce leaves with a few other raw veggies added in like i have seen being eaten on most korean food shows,1
noticeable in some of the pictures from other yelpers,1
red or white,1
korean operated,1
very good much better than our first experience,1
more reliable on cooking steak,1
wonderful and comfortable,1
huge you,1

excellent seasoned well crisp outside tender inside the best thing served to us that meal,1
good enough to tempt us to ask for more,1
acceptable but certainly not memorable,1
hard to nail down,1

so disappointing to waste money like that,1
very unassuming from the casino,1

very enjoyable,1
facial at red door,1
able to have lunch,1
knowledgeable and professional,1
pricey as the local resort spas but the facility does not compare,1
convenient for you,1
nice with free covered parking,1
a bit confusing because the parking upstairs is not free,1
overwhelming for customers,1
sure you get what you are looking for,1
lower for every single item,1

incredibly friendly and quick with whatever you wanted,1
amazing and different,1
so due to the sheer arrogance of nonetheless the owner,1
heavy and evidently overdue for changing,1
 way too spicy,1
not bad,1
great with kids,1
content to slink,1
the shorter,1
haired shorter,1
very empathetic,1
evident as agreed the server,1
rare and blue,1
akin to that,1

comfortable with the process and procedure,1
truly unacceptable,1
fresh not old like some other places,1
close to my neighborhood,1
most disappointed with the ribeye steak that i ordered and the scalloped potatoes,1
worse than i could have got at a local grocery,1
as usual,1
amazing would have been 5 stars if the overbearing new manager would not have tried to throw her weight around at the hostess podium and belittle the hostesses work,1
a tad embarrassing,1
able to eat,1
moist and well protected in it is crunchy panko she will,1
more tastier,1
huge but also very tasty,1

top notch,1
very trusted,1
very valid,1
otherwise excellent,1
commensurate with the level of service,1
reasonably generous,1
about to only leave a loonie behind as a tip,1
funny perhaps but also very telling,1
otherwise cheap,1
sure i want to deal with the lasting impression of the last impression made by the servers with respect to tipping,1
very overpriced,1
worth 800 the average price,1
 just fine such as beef tips and rice,1
such as weird brown lettuce on the taco salad,1
overcooked meat on the gyro,1
best selling,1
bacon burger lunch special but not so special,1
good to be expected nothing special though,1
enough to dampen my spirits,1
rubbery and flavorless,1
succulent and tasty,1

bad for business to lose a customer over a few dollars,1
hungry of course,1
quarter hind chicken dipped in heinikein beer batter,1

spicy edamame,1
reasonable happy,1
rich and hot,1
watered down like some,1

even warm lukewarm,1
sure if it is just this location or not because i had heard the food at dickeys was good,1
worth it since he is the best eye,1
prime and clean,1
sure if this place is new,1
pretty cheap mostly all pho places had their broths wrapped in a plastic bag and then put it in another plastic bag with the rest of the fixings but not pho kc,1
up terrible,1
able to have a free sample of the bread that is made fresh daily,1
honest it is at least another 20 minutes,1

more of a salad dressing than a sauce but delicious all the same,1
intense and flavorful,1
different from the south and from cincinnati but delicious all the same,1
tasteless and bland,1
fairly certain all the flavor was tossed out with the water,1
fairly certain they just mashed potatoes and added coloring and some red pepper and called it potato salad,1
nice and not too fancy,1
really friendly and helpful,1
tired of the burgers pizza and subs,1
sure you will enjoy it as much as i do every time,1
really tasty,1

rare in this day and age,1
excellent and helpful,1
much about fine cooking or anything,1
too sweet,1
house made whipped,1
seriously horrible,1
so fast and so friendly,1
quite so at the one in henderson,1
possibly less,1
plain miserable,1
absolutely sure you wish to see it through,1
nice to have more places opening up in such a bland area although i am certain we probably should have waited a few months before giving them a try,1

aware for future consistency purposes,1

early has limited outside seating as well,1
special cajun,1
amazing but the service as well,1
shoddy and lazy,1
difficult to deal with,1
suitable for big crowds,1
skeptical to mix them on my burger so after experimenting on my plate i did discover that no sweet and spicy honey mustard and smoky bbq sauce do not create a favorable taste once mixed together,1
en short,1
soggy and completely tasteless except for a twist of pepper and a sad attempt at a garlic chunk,1
almost overwhelming and extremely salty,1
cozier more personable,1
busy on the friday and weekend dinners,1
bad enough,1
nothing more than a thinly disguised scoop of rice a roni,1
more than happy to give away to anyone who wants it,1

crispy on the outside and moist on the inside but,1
fresh but nothing special,1
disappointing with neither heat or acidity,1

standard as is the antibiotic free beef,1
antibiotic free in that if antibiotics are given the animal products are not sold until they are cleared,1
good knowing when i order in the future,1
extremely soggy,1
anything but heavenly lrb also very runny rrb,1

familiar with this type of food driven debachary,1
heavy tasting,1
oblivious to me,1

unique from their regular menu,1
as satisfied,1
so much easier since i send out birthday flowers at least once a month,1
right on yonge street lrb if that is the same franchise rrb,1
less about the price,1
worth the extra 5 of a star for the rating,1
fair and comparable to most fast food places,1
able to make one a boy for me,1
noisy as heck from car traffic,1
more helpful and kind,1
favorite with a really delicious avocado patty deep fried in addition to a tasty thin beef,1
different not bad but not,1
patient and thoughtful,1

more respectful,1
very ordinary as you can do at home,1
clearly basic,1
small as people have said,1
ok common,1
so disorganized,1
expensive and not very good,1
else to ad,1
too high for the quantity and quality of the food,1
soupy with very little fajita makings,1
very small in size for the price,1
very compassionate to our needs,1
pricey but so worth,1
real simple,1
more reliable,1
slow cooked,1
hard to get off the bone without a knife,1
dry and uninteresting,1

clear of rebelplace,1
patronizing or exploitative,1

knock off,1
happy with the meal at all,1

flavor outstanding,1
plentiful diverse and high,1
quite ready to leave the lot,1

ready to go so i paid lrb thinking it was a little on the pricey side for a nonfancy chinese place but figured the food would be worth it based on the recommendation rrb and was off on my way home,1
seriously yucky,1
reluctant to let us in,1
mad we did not order within 2 minutes,1
not professional,1
sure you order enough for the amount of people there,1
a little thicker not so crispy,1
somewhat questionable,1
only fried,1
very certain that you can ask the chef to fry most of the dumplings for the steamed dumplings they ooze with delicious juices lrb broth rrb that titalize the taste buds just remember to let them cool off a bit lest you want to treat your taste buds to a premature death,1
neither too soft nor too chewy while enveloping the decently sized chunk of filling inside,1
no longer vegetarian,1
certain mouth watering,1
a little disappointed with the braised beef pancake wraps because my old university friends raved about these all the time,1

consistently horrible,1
too many latin,1
steaming hot,1
immaculate and this resto is worth 5 stars based on that alone,1
hugely lacking in southern dining options,1
a bit sporadic,1
great like they want to be there and serve you,1

special so that is what this review is i have not yet gone here for dinner,1
unbeatable for what you get,1
a little early,1
 30 lighter,1
more than a fried,1

impossible to find good chinese food in the valley that is not from a chain like pei wei,1
so disgusted by what i saw,1
shocked to hear such thing,1
free since she said nothing is free,1
clean looking,1
willing to give the dealer a chance,1
interested in working with me to pick it up in this condition,1

super happy with the meal the craft cocktails the ambiance just everything,1
fairly decent for the quality of the food,1
a little thick and very slightly rubbery,1
away but definitely worth,1
accustomed to paying 1000 for 6 dumplings,1

smaller and more flexible,1
open for about eight of them,1
close random,1
laughable with a few peoples cars,1
as bad with trash bags lrb or dog poop everywhere rrb littered everywhere,1
so bad they become unrideable which means you will need to walk up all four flights of stairs,1
visible if you view a crime map,1
busy talking to each other,1
so incapable,1
a lot better for a lot less available,1
more than glad to answer them here,1

more upbeat,1
prerenovation and postrenovation,1
cleaner and aesthetically pleasing,1
wrong with the steamed dumplings,1

juicy and meaty,1
afraid to bring a larger group,1
amazing for the amount of dumplings,1
very flat,1
blended properly before cooking,1
really spicy and flavourful,1
nice to come to once in a while,1
way too overpriced for the portions,1
disgusting you will not imagine you get your drinks there,1

double layered,1
both exciting and chaotic,1
fresh and flavourful,1
surprising with the new building,1
wheelchair accessible,1
a little sad that i can not see as much now because the counter wall is a bit higher,1
full of cars on a regular basis,1
more disappointed,1
so unremarkable,1
even more bland than my dish which involved mostly green beans,1
very excited to have what i thought would be a great chinese food option so close to home,1
obviously rough,1
blue in the face,1
hard to believe that any type of management staff could be so utterly inept but trust me,1
as inept hopeless and utterly brainless,1
so sorry i could not prevent you from making what will undoubtedly be one of the worse mistakes of your life,1
closer to the 2 side,1
so tasteless and bland,1
udon like,1
the layer thick,1
quite savory,1

ready to head on down the highway,1
nervous it was going to be pricey,1

very immature,1
very unprofessional and rude,1
no problem finding,1
warm moist,1

unhelpful and the,1
right on the flight path of incoming planes,1
open during the day,1
incredibly loud,1
very very long,1

70 year old,1
overly generous at this point,1
way more than we can eat and take away the rest for reheating at home another day,1
almost as much,1
spicy and dry,1
very corporate,1

a bit more,1
able to lower my monthly payment by another 20 a month and overall cost by over 2200,1
very pleased to have worked with two gentlemen who came acrossed as patient honest and went above and beyond what i expected from them from a service standpoint,1
great to see that they make it in house,1
perfectly soft and sweet and still warm,1
overall i,1
most conflicted,1

average but not fantastic,1
med rare,1
so unwelcomed,1
dented damaged,1
hard to find a similar vietnamese restaurant after visiting pho mi asia,1

very busy around 5 pm,1
sure if it was coincidence or the way we looked lrb dressed pretty casual,1
so much better than this,1
prompt and delivered,1
very unfortunate,1
surprisingly refreshing,1
much of a difference between the 4 5 pho,1
especially good on a cold night,1
surprised to see how fast we were seated,1
alright but not amazing,1
just ordered,1
willing to joke around while still providing great customer service,1
delighted to be dining in a finer atmosphere than your average chinese buffet,1
slightly outdated,1
very friendly with years of knowledge,1
fresh full and crunchy,1
full of flavor with a panko like crust and even more savory after squeezing fresh lemon,1
open for lunch hours,1
better off just calling the police,1
incredibly sad,1
much too concerned with getting paid the ridiculous amounts that they charge for every little thing to care about trivial things like the safety of their tenants,1
willing to pay a little extra to feel safe and content with the services provided to me,1
serviced by completely inept management and security,1
absolutely miserable,1
incredibly insulting,1
unplugged and the,1
bold faced,1
cleaner that it was when we moved in,1
right outside our door,1

overpriced and average,1
incredibly sad of them,1
both average and desperate,1
owned and run,1
able to find it,1
not able to read a word of chinese,1

uninspiring to me,1
able to find a cocktail to like here,1
friendly to repeat customers,1
mouthwateringly perfect so refreshing,1
perfect to share with 23 ppl so everyone can have a little taste,1
surprisingly crunchy,1
good for that person who is apprehensive about latin foods or not a huge fan of unique combinations of flavour,1
great for a date night,1
out to celebrate,1
15 house made,1
vegan available,1
evan fried more like over baked with no flavor,1
highly disappointed in the service we received as well definitely,1

larger than average,1
spinning lazy,1
hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time,1
decent on the shrimp dinner and much larger,1
very trustworthy and very thorough,1
too serious,1
so little about what you are doing that you can not get even the basic things right,1
even possible to have such a positive car buying experience,1
terrific with follow up and thoroughness,1
extremely knowledgeable about the ins and outs of the mazda 6,1
straightforward and concise,1
dirty after talking money,1
completely unrelated to this sale,1
happy to learn of the efforts made to give to the community as a portion of the sale of our car went directly to the phoenix children s hospital in our name,1
enough because of how many times i have gone in and complained,1
responsible for paying those,1
more than enough spots for everyone,1
so spot,1
only great,1
better off looking elsewhere,1
more affordable and cleaner,1
busy so you never wait for anything,1
happy to find out happy hour does not end until 7 pm at sierra gold lrb some places end too early rrb,1
free to enroll,1
good enough to quench our thirst,1

it necessary,1
just as helpful and honest as he was at a reputable dealership,1
very very nice and professional about everything,1
something cheap,1
so addicting,1
good for more intimate settings and parties,1
a bit strange,1
pretty okay,1
really full from already eating the previous items,1
so excited about this,1
fresh to order as you watch,1
both hot and sour,1
too oily or fried and still super flavourful,1
crowded from all the people trying to make that 11 am breakfast,1
clear across the casino floor,1
unable to complete the holy trinity of unhealthy philadelphia fast food which i love so much 1 rrb cheesesteaks 2 rrb cheese fries and then 3 rrb tastykakes for dessert,1
better off staying almost anywhere,1
a bit too casual,1
delicious good,1
very saucy,1
trendy new but not solid nor exciting,1
too high for the quality of the food,1
meh okay,1
sure i owed nothing else before moving out and continued to receive bills from them a year later,1
the absolute worst,1
money causing,1
not only that when i was trying to pull in since it was a busy day for them there were some parked cars blocking the entry after calling in they,1
allergic to shrimps,1
only acceptable,1
average on some days they are bad,1
less than thrilled to have to help,1
more worried about her phone and the game,1
unfortunate for them,1
notorious for scamming extra money out of you ever month for going over on your utility credit,1
very close to school,1
so happy with my new apartments,1
happy to sit down and chit chat,1
spectacular cozy and romantic,1
very flavourful and very spicy,1
very impressed with the service,1
pretty curious,1
much on it that was terribly interesting or unique,1
busy or closed,1

mildly cheesy,1
buttery fresh and delish,1
nice open and clean,1
much better than others,1
much bigger it seemed,1
so impressed by this,1
painfully slow,1
plain wrong,1
so hungry we just ate it anyways,1
cheerful and timely,1
sure your dining experience is everything you would want it to be,1
family owned and operated,1
great for take out,1
extremely professional courteous and easy to work with,1
able to work out a schedule where i could drop the vehicle in the morning pick it up after work to take it home and bring it back the next day,1
impressed with the honest pricing lrb i always compare new shops with my regular mechanic rrb and the no pressure explanations,1

a little too busy,1
great for locals,1
so much more i wanted to try,1
prompt attentive and friendly,1
ok for a chain,1
interested in buying any car from anyone,1
desperate to take advantage of anyone,1
dumb enough to buy from them again,1
sure every last drop got inside my belly,1
light and fluffy and simply delicious,1
lunch special ordered,1
great for dinner,1
tasty spicy,1
enough for two meals,1
willing to pay for services,1

warm and very good,1
perfectly seasoned and nice,1
very helpful and knowledgeable,1
able to make suggestions to help us with what to order,1
absolutely nothing wrong with this place,1
much more relaxed and affordable,1
out of my boyfriend s prime rib,1
due to bad customers,1
quite surprised by the stylish decor,1
unique and special,1
quite charming,1
stylish modern,1
face felt,1
jam packed with noodles meat shrimp and surprises,1
consistent in their delivery,1
most familiar,1
so gooey,1
a lot better than subway s version,1
best as it was the closest to the way she makes her own food familiarity is her comfort,1
indian and chinese,1
crazy salty,1

once beloved,1
flavourful yet light,1
too wary to return,1
outrageous for bar food,1
very bland came out 3 minutes after we ordered,1
able to fix the problem within 24 hours,1
so tasty that my boyfriend cleaned his plate even after he would filled up on apps lrb i should mention that even for a large group we were able to share most of the apps which was great because we could not get enough of all the different flavors oops except the biscuits pretty much everyone wanted to get their own love at first bite rrb the collard greens that came with the subtly spicy fried chicken full of shaved fresh garlic and sweet spicy with a silky vinegary finish not your average bland collard,1
light and fluffy yet sumptuously rich,1
much truly,1

confusing and chaotic,1
unique and good,1
pretty romantic with dim lighting and spanish music,1

green peppers onions and mushrooms lrb love mushrooms,1
hot at all in fact,1
greasy and great,1
difficult to pay our check,1

maybe two tablespoons worth,1
most remedial,1
both yummy and more,1
many many,1
particularly delicious,1
stingy on the ice cream,1

fair with my trade,1
more knowledgable about the car and their competition,1
good about my experience,1
utterly amazed to find a place with chicken in its name that did not know how to fry a good chicken,1
really possible,1
most crucial,1
very succulent and tasty,1
quantity wise,1
crowded as congee wing and congee queen,1
particularly bad and i felt so bad for my husband who is normally a very easy going guy and very loyal,1

very accommodating and understanding,1
dirty with trash laying around,1
a bit scary,1
really disgusted,1

utterly confused,1
delicious with the hot pot,1
a wee bit slow,1
late to arrive to our table,1
a bit unresponsive,1
tough tasty,1
sure you have enough place on your table before you order the paper dosa,1
a bit higher than the competition,1
too big for me,1
too many people would share this nit,1
and more than enough,1
so dry it tasted like beef jerky on a bone,1
next to nothing,1
too tired from hours of video,1
a little too young,1
sooo unique delicious,1
supper nice,1
10 jam packed,1
so much harder for me,1
pretty convenient,1
surprised to see gamjatang here so i may try that next time,1
super friendly and funny,1
other and private,1
super chatty but slow,1
thick and sugar sweet,1
very generous for the price,1
compelled to drive there from downtown for food,1
somewhat regular,1
willing to eat faux meat in the form of soy products,1
willing to do,1

sad to say it,1
rather oily,1
confusing at first,1
a little small for the price,1
apprehensive about car shops,1
not bad but way too much,1
happy to see a local gem available at the airport,1

interested on this place to eat,1
ready for pick up right on time,1
available on the menu,1
totally fine with that,1
friendly and courteous,1
able to taste a number of dishes,1
the portions big,1
helpful to those who are new to south asian dining,1
very nicely seasoned so it was very flavourful,1
overly spicy,1
chicken very very nice,1
self acclaimed,1
delicious as it was,1
a little cheated,1
cheaper to serve,1

a little more exciting,1
a bit marginal,1
the waitress that makes them so next time we will just skip it or stick with something easy,1
so good at what they do,1

about 12 13 years old,1
sure to remember to squeeze a hint of lime juice to heighten your tastebuds,1
excited to get my usual the ceaser salad with chicken critters lrb breaded fried chicken rrb,1
dry overcooked,1
sad to say that i am not sure i plan on going back any time soon,1

either too mild or too strong,1
about half empty,1
bland and super greasy,1
gross after eating at this joint,1
not too salty or greasy and always saucy enough,1

how disrespectful and stupid,1
dark and cool,1
ok la in my opinion,1
short haired,1
really mad and ok,1

child friendly,1
famous in the phoenix area,1
super crispy yet moist,1
not pleased with customer service,1
happy to see this in terminal 4 presecurity,1

sure i update every single address on every single mail,1
slightly higher at this location,1
a perfect medium rare,1

skeptical of the service department,1
okay with me,1
weed central and too many,1
fine the baked potatoes we are hot and large,1
very overcooked and dry,1
disappointed in our steaks,1
bad so far with the service department but not 5 star worthy,1
creative and well selected,1
hillbilly hot,1
progressively worse over the last few years,1
reasonably short,1
relaxed and pleasant,1
comfortably low,1
mediocre to bad,1
greasy and heavy with very little flavor,1
so sweet it might as well be syrup,1
entirely unremarkable,1
thick and also fairly sweet,1
very greasy and watery,1
too bad they do not have any of it at the restaurant,1
much better more authentic more balanced and less heavy chinese food available,1
more like fall,1
surprisingly not too gamey,1
nicely marbled and thinly sliced,1
hesitant to check the place out,1
bland and not distinctive,1
no more than that chicken in what appeared to be clumps of hellmann s mayo or something,1
fine but a bit odd,1
so lame,1
tired of reading yet,1
the name tall,1
this woman real,1
worth my time,1
so happy with her new car,1
often enough to become a regular,1
back open,1
very under unexpected tragic conditions,1
embarrassed for lolo s to be associated with this airport location,1
ok disappointing,1
fifteen minute,1
there early enough for my boyfriend to eat then catch his flight,1
more like cheese soup just runny and not at all good,1
interested in another drink,1

so disappointed and embarrassed for lolo s food and service,1
super bad,1

totally disinterested,1
fairly young,1
fully baked and very doughy,1
so disappointed in the restaurant,1

electronic with more douches,1
excited for the new valdez,1

hard to see in photos,1
very anal,1
casual off colored,1
great from a couple,1
more thoroughly,1
high with his description of the car,1
absolutely false,1
right by reducing the price of the car,1
short of frustrating and downright insulting,1
very dismissive of my feelings,1
normal to have pits like that,1
financially irresponsible not taking him up on his offer,1
first and absolutely,1
super disappointed with this place,1
right across the street,1
horrible they made us wait so long and charged us for things without letting us know first this is the second time i have gone to a pt s run company,1

close to burgers,1
expensive with most burgers,1
happy i tried this place despite the yelp critics,1

life long,1
impressed with the variety and price,1

crispy on the outside,1

difficult to get a refill of water,1
so glad i decided to try this hidden gem,1

 ok i find many of their employees lack the interest of working there,1
ready to pay a lot more,1
fluffy light,1
far too overpriced,1
great for a quick snack mid day,1
terribly dry,1
hard to enjoy,1
delicious and refreshing tart but not too much,1
enjoyable with the fresh chips,1
homey with a rustic look,1
sushi japanese,1
great to get a break from just being able to order generic avocado rolls cucumber rolls yam tempura etc,1
ayce japanese,1
much more varied,1
quite slow at times lrb depending on which guy is working behind the counter making the sushi rrb,1
worth the price difference,1
more for dinner,1

unbelievably above,1
most crazy,1
sure we did not get lost or confused,1
delighted in our experience,1
moist and simple,1
hot good and well extra,1
the best ever to touch your lips and gums,1
long and pretty deep,1
sure that they have changed managers between now and back then 9 years ago,1
ok with doing your own rotations and paying for a balance once before the tires wear out,1
busy and full,1
big enough to fit the 10 or so kids that were in it every time,1
very helpful to this single mother of three,1
super tiny,1
impressed at the lengths to which the restaurant went to mimic the flavour appearance and texture of meat,1
a bit surreal,1
delicious and more,1
quiet on a weeknight,1
small on the inside,1
blues rock band called,1
impressive for a mostly barbecue place,1
really cool they had that option,1
too full to try it,1

great and similar to any other mexican restaurant,1
fond of,1
frozen lime,1
open 365 days,1
funny looking white thing lots of arms,1
hard to judge the food because i have never wished to try vegetarian sushi given the choice of real fish versus some hard jelly that is made to look and feel like salmon,1
nice and funny enough,1
flat in my run,1
able to fix it at no charge,1
sweet efficient and very friendly,1
really authentic and wonderful,1
great from burritos tortas quesadillas y mas,1

fabulous during memorial day,1
nervous about getting in during the busiest weekend of the year,1
rude offensive,1
vintage and decorative,1
super communicative,1
authentic mexican,1
absurdly full from stuffing my face before hand,1
too watery in my opinion,1
more on the creamy slightly sweeter side rather than watery and kind of sweet,1
light and flavorful,1
worth it and prices are cheap,1
available in other stores,1
baby blue colored,1
very talkative,1
special ordered,1
far more than what i am used to,1
different with candied pecans on top wihich,1
immaculate and attentive,1

great with polynesian sauce,1
prompt to,1
fresh creative and inspiring,1
easy to replicate sushi or duck pork using soy,1
better i definitely will not dine in again,1
wonderfully extra,1
plant based,1
a little too real for my tastebuds to handle,1
nice if you are buying,1
inclined to enjoy a pretzel by itself rather than topped with a mess of goodness,1
quite as large as the ones,1
suspect and just not,1
pretty doughy,1
simple with no flavor,1
just okay to me,1
pretty big with lots of options,1
so excited to find a place in downtown mesa with vegan grilled cheese,1
surprisingly difficult,1
relleno and something fried,1
savory to sweet,1
a little bigger,1
completely surprised by the sight,1
most flavorless,1
moldy and rotten,1
very short with us and very miserable,1
back to waffles inc,1
fantastic better,1
angry about something,1
even more surprised,1
able to repair it free of charge just as promised,1
so glad i found her,1
a little difficult for the gluten sensitive vegan like my partner but sometimes we just brave through the sandwiches,1
overly packed with people and or merchandise which is a plus for myself,1
a tad slow,1
able to get my tire in next day,1
good really overpriced,1
really clean for a fast food place,1
strange that i like this store more than the one in my nyc neighborhood,1
more luxuriously professional,1
polite and yet professional,1
not to love about this store,1
so eager to try it,1
not willing,1
happy to spend time there twice for what should have been done,1
perfect for the vibe,1
comforting but not the best,1
able to finish mine,1
a bit softer than i like,1
very fair and honest,1
great quick and fair,1
quite impressed with the food,1
good enough for us to keep trying,1
so glad we did keep coming back because it seems like they have done a complete 360,1
right or hot,1
right hot and timely,1
quick efficient and attentive,1
rather impressive due to their looks and taste,1
pretty unique in the markham area,1
perfect for downtown mesa,1
about time,1
healthy as well as delish,1
all high and mighty,1
funny considering you,1
very good and generous,1
fresh and piping hot,1
really beautiful,1
busy for supper lunch time,1
a little expensive,1
most iconic,1
delicious so much better than the typical cucumber and avocado rolls,1
varied delicate and complex,1
closer to my place,1
spicy deluxe and label on the sandwich box also shows spicy deluxe,1
delicious at an amazing price,1
able to linger around,1
so good he ate the entire bowl,1
pretty positive that la unica has new owners over the past few months,1
mexican right by my house with outdoor seating,1
fresh and they give you mild and spicy can not complain with that,1
speedy and friendly,1
able to get a table outside,1
glad i gave this place a try,1
super polite and so nice,1
really good but not worth it if they have chosen to lower their quality of food,1
great i love the cheddar and jalapeno for only 1 dollar it is as cheap as eats get,1
baked good,1
expensive for 2 sandwiches and 3 sides,1
both fantastic,1
a bit small considering soft drink costs next to nothing on tap,1
quick considering how busy it was,1
willing to pay extra for decent comfort food,1
so excited for this place,1
highly disappointed this time considering my first experience here was great,1
this surprisingly good,1
a little smaller than expected but sharing with two people,1
super impressed with the imitate salmon sashimii,1
really interested to know how they make such great imitate japanese sushi and sashimi,1
really expensive and really long,1
surprised with my very spare portion,1
homemade and so delicious,1
so good they will break your mouth,1
dense and chewy,1
pretty atrocious,1
congenial knowledgeable,1
due to the overall sales,1
happy to give the sale to a rep that earned it,1
delightfully delicious,1
scared that this location is so close to my house,1
overcooked et le formage etait,1
free on a saturday with skrillex and a free drink for the ladies,1
delicious fresh quick,1
not too much,1
happy with that 4th star,1

kind of rough,1
sure to just pay attention and drive carefully,1
japanese chinese and thai,1
quite standard,1
light maybe too light,1
all super oily,1
compatible to the non vegetarian version,1
disappointed in the way,1
great to have to discount something,1
able to hear the singer which is insane for how small the place is,1
so poorly run,1
all spectacular,1
able to eat it,1
ok had a few jokes but no drink refills or anything like that,1
allergic to kids beware,1
great and taste even better,1
super polite,1
overpriced expensive,1
ok but not great they had baby chairs but did not offer it even though i was holding a baby,1
i glad we did,1
quite warm,1
seasoned really well,1
mostly dead,1
surprised to see the same level of service,1
a little small for my preference but the coffee itself is great,1
hardworking courteous,1
cool enough to plug tires i did not buy at discount tire for free,1
friendly efficient and extremely convenient,1
polite and pleasant,1
top available,1
cold every time someone came in or out which happened frequently,1
most innovative,1
good to see one local business supporting another,1
fine in summer,1
too much about the hospitality industry,1
different than many,1
watered down not fresh,1
a bit sceptical of this place from the outside,1
so juicy,1
authentic and very good,1
all angry at the world,1
cold and limp,1
good but cold,1
not to love about chik fil a,1
wrong because that is what i ordered and paid for like it said in the receipt,1
very cool and swanky,1
big at the tables,1
healthier than most fast foods,1
sure to try it,1
super fast and very friendly,1
clear at all,1
awkward and confused,1
ok maybe it is some weird fusion concept,1
how precarious,1
neat to tortilla,1
out of receipt paper,1
kind of crazy for 4 tacos and a drink,1
better with just a bit more,1
surprised to see hair inside the jug,1
big of a challenge,1
unsettling to think of the rest of the kitchen,1
relatively soggy,1
busy granted,1

vegan it is not something they make a big deal about,1
accommodating and friendly,1

interested in purchasing to let her know,1
plain rude,1
hard to get,1
pleased with the authenticity of the food,1

most indifferent rude and ridiculous,1
really excited to try this place ever since we found out it would replace loco lime lrb which by the way was pretty decent rrb,1
very confused about how to mix the ingredients,1
needless to say it tasted like coconut water so,1
extremely small,1
interesting to note that the other waitresses were sitting at the bar chatting and on their phones,1
much more to the table,1
much tastier,1
well seasoned and juicy,1
happy to offer up sauces with your order in case you want to jazz up your sandwich or fries,1
relatively bad,1
drab and overly salted and remarkably tough,1
good maybe better than good but not outstanding,1
poor at best,1
attentive enough but not too much,1
more economical to get a few bento box orders,1
comparable to sushi places with real meat fish,1
quite impressed by how close to the real thing this place got,1
very sizable,1
some chinese thai,1
super crispy and sweet and sour sauce reaches the perfect balance between the two tastes,1
perfect for visiting all the local shops nearby,1
similar to cornish pasty,1
so glad i contacted her to help get the best experience in las vegas last past week,1
very pleasant and prompt,1
just okay and somewhat lackluster,1
delicious because of the homemade goodness inside of them,1
significantly smaller and more expensive than other mexican joints,1
amazing and always fresh,1
sure my insurance gave me the proper compensation for the damage done to my tires,1
likely to make at home with amazing specialty syrups lrb we get every one for different bites rrb,1

above average,1
too impressed with his food,1
great at letting me know all of our options,1
just horrible,1
dangerously close to a chain restaurant,1
amazing hot or cold,1
awesome so hit them up,1
even crowded,1
too high off of the ground,1
disproportional to the ground,1
excited to get my nachos,1
pleasantly surprised with this little shop,1
happy that they did not have either goodyear,1
general for my 95 ford explorer,1
out of there,1
closer to like 30 minutes,1
sure if dustin was the guy that put the tire on,1
expensive so will probably come for the odd sushi fix but will not be a regular,1
accurate on yelp,1
underwhelming and slightly uncomfortable,1
dumb for not knowing,1
spectacular not good enough to brace the awkwardness,1
smoked then fried,1
juicy with a crispy skin,1
pleasingly subtle smoky,1
super chill and intimate,1
mild and spicy,1
extreme to have to yelp,1
allergic to pickles,1
too busy to talk to me,1
filled out,1
regional and general,1
both very helpful and responsive,1
beautiful but very impractical,1
perfect to buy,1
beautifully made up,1
okay in vegas,1
very awkwardly,1
pretty confident about declining to open up a credit card,1
that is,1
tender and smoky,1
even vegan,1
sure to hit her up for sure if you are out here,1
very favorite,1
pretty well priced,1
proud to say that i will never stop going to chick fil a,1
rushed and impersonal,1
sure it is right,1
supremely apologetic,1
other than needing some seasoning,1
all right looks like an old fashion dinner,1
decent and classic,1
optional with the tortas,1
able to grab a spot,1
so we were able to get seated right away,1
open until 3 pm,1
too busy and nice and quiet,1
program so,1
able to get a waffle free,1
great and only for spicy lovers like me,1
open for a month,1
aware that there is no diaper changing station,1
clean good,1
confident you could enjoy a mexican meal here,1
very flavorful and delicious,1
able to come by,1
near empty,1
really excited to try volstead because it is another of the highly rated spots in downtown mesa,1
crazy about the food,1
too cheesy for me,1
very quiet and not too crowded,1
addicted to the grilled chicken and fruit salad,1
quick and tasty,1
impressed with the range of sandwich offerings and variations of pretzels,1
all really tasty and filling,1
full of regulars,1
clear from the efficient and friendly service,1
toddler approved,1
less on tax,1
truly enough,1
all the more better,1
easy to miss it,1
sure you take cash since they do not take credit debit cards,1
full of pretzels,1
vegan lrb and not so vegan rrb,1
very flavourful and filling,1
able to get into all the great clubs with short notice,1
so close and kind of mad at myself,1

easy to just say there was nothing,1
super early in the morning,1
super friendly staff and always clean,1
quite knowledgable,1
impeccable with a 50s style,1
quite happy,1
quite exhaustive,1
possible one person can eat this in 60 minutes,1
more suited for 4 adults,1
a bit too complicated,1
so simple,1
delicious messy,1
self described,1
hard so discarded it,1
mad about the fact,1
pricier than regular boring burger joints,1
bothered to take care of us,1
less than acceptable,1
friendly fast and courteous,1
tender and well seasoned,1
too sweet i hate that,1
incredibly friendly and fun,1
good job la,1
free chips and salsa,1
hard to find a place to sit,1
picnic tableesque,1

a lot more with healthy meat options and meat sides,1
excited to get a deal,1

sure to shop around if price is matters to you,1
much about guest lists,1
simply fabulous,1
tooled around with the bf service was lazy,1
almost perfectly wonderful,1
incredibly creative,1
mild and hot,1
very authentic and very tasty,1
so glad to see this type of place on main in downtown mesa,1
delicious but pricey,1
amazing looking store,1
too bad for her,1
really steep,1
so sweet and nice,1
small but perfect,1
tender and delicious,1
awesome and very informative,1
awesome to sit in or takeout,1
pretty sure the chicken was just a frozen patty,1
muy tiny,1
friendly and fresh,1
cool and warm,1
truly mediocre,1
kind of important,1
hard to find at restaurants,1
only disappointing,1
very reasonable from what i remember,1
small and not quite as large,1
friendly and willing,1
sure you will find some amazing new threads to make those ladies swoon,1
able to work her magic,1
thrilled to find out,1
too strong for me,1
medium fried,1
excited for it,1
fair at best,1
very good lrb a little too salty rrb but not enough to bring us back,1
happy to have another breakfast spot in wexford,1
interested in me,1
a few smaller,1
4th or 5th,1
more than mine,1
pretty overpriced,1
nice to see a small business being busy,1
hot for the price,1
willing to give the place another shot but,1
very happy with the selection,1
a bit challenging,1
perfect for a late breakfast on a saturday,1
willing to wait over 30 minutes for a waffle,1
a bit intimidating with all of the options,1
too enthused with places like this,1
so decadent,1
afraid the meal will be a punch you in the mouth sweetness that will inevitably be cavity inducing,1
so impressed with the flavors in my meal rather than the sweetness,1
greasy for a couple,1
rushed or rude,1
about 3 salespeople available,1
positive they saw me standing around the bags too,1
far more helpful and friendly,1
super disappointed with the customer service,1
so excited to try it out,1
extremely friendly and attentive,1
pretty fair for the size and amount of food,1
a bit doughy,1
quick and hardy,1
hot or sweet,1
equally delicious hot dog filled,1
chatty and sociable,1
very good kind of dry,1
tastier and jucier,1
so devoted,1
extremely late,1
quite a bit higher,1
hard to get into the shop,1
able to stop by the store,1
hard to find in an age where companies push customers in and out,1
quite disappointed with the sushi and sashimi,1
quite greasy,1
curious about tenon s ayce,1
very nice and quick,1
delicious amazing,1
cool and dimly lit,1
immediately and very helpful,1
so juicy and fresh,1
hard and crusty,1
most terrific,1
so kid friendly,1
absolutely free,1
consistently friendly and engaging,1
par with reaching out to drug,1
skeevy and uncomfortable,1
friendly knowledgeable and helpful,1
very hard to remove the nail himself,1
free to go,1
pressured to make a purchase,1
quite impressed with the results,1
absolutely perfectly prepared,1
able to identify,1
a little doughy,1
nearly crispy enough,1
disappointed and really,1
so happy to have found this place,1
worth the hour drive,1
very southern,1
grateful for a place to have meetings and grab a bite that impresses every time,1
cool and comfortable,1
taste delicious,1
pretzel related,1
sweet but not too sweet,1
really arbitrary,1
rather sloppy and wet,1
eccentric unusual,1
amazingly customer support,1
clean every table when the person leaves and another clean every 5 minutes so there is that,1
cleanthe drive thru also serves the best drive thru food,1
sure my party was properly accommodated,1
much more amazing,1
quiet on a friday night,1
quite convincing,1
sure i liked the imitation fish as it could be described as a moist sponge with a fishy taste,1
very much enjoy the rolls with bean curd on top though,1
able to bring in our own cake,1
empty or full,1
slow to new levels,1
still excellent,1
salty sweet,1
good for breakfast,1
clean the customers there were laughing and talking,1
much lower than my expectation,1
kid approved,1
sure and super delicious,1
super yummy and super friendly,1
cute it blows my mind,1
extremely lively on sunday,1
lrb silly me rrb,1
so authentic so pittsburgh,1
sure if that is a preference the customer can select or if it is just random,1
still too warm,1
blasphemous towards a pittsburgh tradition,1
excited to try some of the things they have at volstead,1
a little heavy on the cheese,1
more green,1
sure that i would rush back here,1
glad we finally tried it,1
robust and flavorful,1
helpful without being smothering,1
cheesy looking,1
big and sloppy,1
small but tiny and clear,1
too oily at all,1
even though i ready,1
excited for all the great reviews on yelp,1
surprised since breakfast,1
possible could to fix the situation,1
unforgettable one,1
definatley going back,1
bland and not very tasteful,1
very unsatisfied,1
full of grounds,1
mind boggling,1
tasty 20,1
absurd is how delicious they are,1
right out of the oven stored in an airtight container,1
fun and loud,1
reasonable for the quality and quantity of food,1
easy and comfortable,1
real or authentic,1
available right now to compare to in the toronto area,1
absolutely spectacular,1
worth my gas money to drive back,1
really germy,1
enough about you,1
random crazy,1
ok at omnia,1
ok at xs,1
amazing as was the coffee,1
lady owned,1
excited to try their other food,1
great enough to provide me with that one,1
light and spongy,1
full with yummy syrupy fluffy goodness for a good portion of the day,1
awesome when they are fresh out of the fryer unfortunately the batch i got yesterday were cold and tasted like an ashtray,1
most reliable,1
glad to see downtown revitalized,1
great inside,1
cheaper than discount,1
even close to a 4 but instead all an 8,1
so easy to work with,1
quick and responsive,1
surprised and impressed,1
very busy it was there first cinco de mayo,1
fueran atendidas con bebidas salsas y chips,1
hard to handle when i have an aching hangover,1
full of onions and extra spicy unsure why it was like that,1
very nice and cozy,1
overly impressive,1
not terrible not fantastic,1
near around the plaza midwood area,1
genuinely friendly,1
beer empty,1
even crazier,1
all pretty healthy for you,1
modest clean cozy,1
nice enough to give me a coffee anyways,1
really grateful to have a local business that really takes care of us,1
as cheap as it once was,1
a little long around lunch time,1
noisy and chaotic,1
over rated and over priced,1
a bit strange and quite possibly extremely unnecessary,1
worth writing a little snippet for the always refreshing chick fil a,1
nice to have a fast food experience where the food tastes fresh and actually like real chicken,1
right at noon,1
ready in a flash,1
dirty and deeeeeelicious,1
too cool to even acknowledge us,1
so silent i felt uncomfortable even ordering,1
mind blowing but tasty,1
underwhelming and barely melted,1
fake or too intrusive,1
disappointing to say the least as it was dry and tasteless,1
fantastic for a quick lunch,1
more than capable of expressing any unmet needs,1
vendor so much,1
so engaging,1
back here great,1
women s clothing classic,1
good for mexican food,1
typical for most places like this,1
dense salty doughy just barely underbaked,1
glad to see there is humor still in the work environment,1
speedy and thorough,1
bad for not leaving more of a tip,1
amazing with the fella working came out to see how we were doing and even offered to put the unfinished ice cream lrb that the kid did not eat rrb,1
vegetarian salmon like,1
worth checking out since i do not know any vegetarian sushi places that have imitated raw fish,1
high for small plate,1
all cold even,1
 cold and unhelpful,1
vegan cheese available,1
helpful and very nice,1
aware that the place tends to get loud we were there when the live entertainment was not playing,1
entirely too long to wait,1
so hungry and cranky that no one cared what the food tasted like by that point,1
slowly sloppily,1
deliberate on their part,1
worthwhile to go for the ayce options based on some quick math,1
all around fine,1
a little grainy a little gross,1
perfectly sanitary,1
good crisp and chewy,1
definitely better than some of the others,1
average in cost,1
responsible for us having a spectacular time,1
sure we have a great time,1
crisp and light,1
perfectly crisp without being oily,1
modern clean,1
conducive to a huge shopping spree,1
able to try different dishes,1
very sparse,1
closer to where i live or work,1
tough and not particularly flavorful,1
fine but nothing special,1
so surprised to taste the meat and have all that awesome flavor,1
very jelly like,1
nice and smoky,1
humongous but still very,1
super helpful getting all the ladies in for free and free drinks,1
so helpful for such high demand clubs,1
sure to get some pretzels after they come out of the oven and are still warm so good,1
courteous and genuine,1
sweet savory,1
spacious but still intimate,1
as fast or attentive,1
much about the menu,1
then fresh out of the oven,1
overly impressed with anything,1
just lousy,1
nice not to need repeat customers,1
uniquely seasoned,1
so impressed with the patience and kindness of the workers at chick fil a,1
so nice and proactive with getting you,1
educational and interactive,1
no vegetarian and no vegan,1
quite ignorant,1
very beautiful and outgoing,1
professional and yet colorful too,1
extremely knowledgable and helpful,1
happy to continue shopping at barney s,1
sure to do well,1
fun too,1
both really hungry,1
delicious peanut y,1
almost reminiscent,1
excellent attentive,1
quick service,1
delicious and hot right out of the kitchen,1
hard to get attention,1
la unica plaza,1
particularly concerned,1
better off with some lime aritas and taco bell in a parking lot,1
popular before a show,1
complete with a lackadaisical attitude,1
so hipster they do not even want you here,1
dry so i could not finish it,1
special at all,1
definitely better in the states,1
other than that an aok experience,1
sure to add other things to my order because hogging a table for 4 is not great,1
real slow during the week,1
too hot for me,1
giant and wonderful,1
super attentive and nice,1
never fun,1
lrb very generous rrb,1
so very happy,1
a tad loud,1
better to not fulfill what we ordered and tried the blame game on somebody else,1
fairly quick to repair lrb the back left tire rrb after that,1
best to book an appointment ahead of time,1
worth that wait,1
the little kids are allowed to run around like a mcdonalds play zone which makes adult time a bit noisy,1
hard to find a decent almond milk latte,1
guilty of being one of those people who love a sweet drink though i am trying to cut more sugar out of my life,1
too loud to have a meeting there,1
sure they would turn it down if there was not too many people there,1
close to impossible,1
surprised such a casual restaurant would not be accommodating to families,1
good if not great,1
100 sure,1
tough to walk by and not pick up some pretzels to take home,1
great as left overs days,1
so cold it seemed like it came straight out of the walk in,1
akin to a rocking chair,1
too close to the minibooths,1
loud enough for us to hear each other chew cos she is a loud chewer,1
messy but really good,1
a little more professional than the one on ray rd,1
more knowledgeable about what they are doing,1
fabulous as close as to my gmas home cooking as it gets,1
sure the customers would appreciate it,1
clean soft and rejuvenated,1
slow but nice,1
great as well,1
la unica as a taco tuesday,1
sure the loud rap music is fun for guys working on cars,1
right past me standing 5 feet from him and parks at the far end of the lot,1
no more,1
ok not as amazing,1
glad i tried this now because nothing here stacks up to it,1
really solid could tell it was fresh cut before fried,1
inspiring but ok,1
quite fascinated by the concept of veggie sushi,1
quite pricey for veggie sushi,1
more traditional than americanized,1
quite dangerous,1
down best,1
regular or vegan,1
a little present,1
most opulent,1
able to purchase comme des garcons new scent wonderwood,1
so excited to wear it out,1
out of everything,1
out of ginger beer,1
happy to have found this place,1
you out hot and mild,1
almost flavorless had to add my own salt and lime,1
deceivingly larger inside compared to how it looks from the exterior,1
compelled to call managment,1
so incredibly warm and friendly,1
no longer mad her cheerfulness and authentic approach was infectious,1
fake or truly great,1
great for group events fast service 1 tacos on tuesdays unlimited nachos,1
no shorter than like 8 minutes,1
other than that the pretzel was everything i imagined it to be,1
salty and soft,1
subpar to what i was expecting with flavorless taste,1
better than the chicken taco,1
so mesmerized,1
petty good a little sour but not bad,1
fresh and spicy,1
most spicy and chunky,1
hard and soft,1
overall ok,1
amazingly authentic,1
no cream for you plain,1
enticingly unique,1
super will organized and clean,1
similar to montreal with their bagels,1
helpful and rude,1
open to see the consistency,1
interested in buying,1
lazy and rude,1
incorrectly prepared,1
fresh delicious and inexpensive,1
wrong with the pretzel shop,1
unnecessarily long,1
decent enough if i needed some mexican food nearby,1
way better than the ones from the mall that are dripping in butter,1
memorable as i can not even remember what i ordered,1
special except for the hair in the salsa bowl,1
very noticeable,1
most likely placed back into a larger vat for reuse later to other customers,1
guilty of judging a book by its cover,1
as adamant,1
afraid of broadening my horizons,1
little more sour,1
so rare around az,1
so glad i have a mexican restaurant to add to my list of happiness,1
so glad my group got connected with michelle,1
quick to reply to our messages,1
super friendly and ready,1
able to get us into the guest lists where our favorite djs were playing,1
a little fatty,1
traditional sweet and hot,1
definitely better than filibertos,1
sure you are taken care of and is always available and attentive,1
hardly finished,1
ready to go sandwiches with meats and cheeses on,1
happy with the quality of the drinks,1
off needless,1
a bit small so they are not filling,1
an avocado based,1
vegan japanese,1
similar to konjac lrb konnyaku rrb or jelly,1
busy due to people who are vegetarian on these specific days,1
pretty big i am going to,1
consistently awful,1
ok at best,1
worth a look,1
most polite and great,1
so empty and large,1
less than adequate,1
quite underwhelming,1
how sweet,1
glad my diet does not start until next week,1
super fresh and crunchy,1
so unbelievably pricey,1
 1 authentic,1
extremely bland and skimpy,1
remotely good,1
good and crunchy,1
very fast responsive,1
so easy to work with just a few simple texts,1
friendly and very clear,1
so glad i stuck to my guns and did not pay some outrageous fee that the other companies charge,1
very professional will definitely be back,1
very overpriced for the quality of food you get,1
very yummy and reasonably priced,1
tasty either hot or cold,1
sure to tell them light salt,1
not dried out,1
good for kids,1
amazing and definitely worth a try to satisfy your vegan palate,1
incredibly tasty,1
absolutely delicious but lukewarm,1
too busy to stop for refills,1
too busy to be on top of these kinds of things during peek times,1
worse than what i imagine the sandwiches in gas station coolers taste like,1
food bright,1
truly disgusting,1
worst terrible,1
necessary to have 5 teen girls in the window,1
super reliable,1
especially michelle,1
more than enough as an appetizer or a meal,1
how amazing and delicious,1
thick smoky,1
large enough for us to have left overs for a perfect late night snack,1
continuously busy,1
pretty good although,1
most salty,1
really inexpensive,1
too like,1
happy with the meals,1
lucky enough to try my nieces waffle with some bourbon maple syrup,1
both good,1
very hit,1
very happy with the mac and cheese at wheelfish,1
sure to bring your appetite because the servings are pretty generous,1
very retro and fun,1
a little spicier,1
overdone but still good,1
more better,1
clean and very shop able,1
tasty and not greasy,1
huge with lots of space,1
embarrassed to reveal the number of times,1
helpful without being in your face,1
out happier,1
important right,1
sooooooooo sweet,1
smooth and very efficient,1
very versatile,1
so friendly and very helpful,1
professional and efficient,1
able to get my issue fixed with my tire plus give me a free rotation,1
excited to grab some dinner and drinks here,1
clearly overwhelmed,1
interested in helping her,1
dry without any sauce,1
how courteous and hard,1
very satisfied with them,1
nuts not cheap,1
 sorry in the most condescending way possible,1
horrible and rude,1
sure what happened,1
serviced at exactly that time,1
quick to jump in and help,1
nice to see leaders lead,1
very inexpensive much less pricey than the typical auntie annes inside malls,1
very happy with her excellent service,1
dr sebagh deep,1
easy and delicious,1
fancy about this place just consistently good,1
completely vegan,1
too bland for my tastes,1
sure to stop here for lunch,1
unfamiliar with their menu,1
open to 1030,1
glad to support them,1
full of crumbs or sticky,1
good with any sausage for example mayo ranch or polynesian,1
weak with very limited selections,1
freshly fried and so delicious,1
so happy with my meal,1
sad that it is 1 hr away from me,1
more than i,1
similar sounding,1
fresh but underdressed,1
a bit bland to me,1
smooth and rich with a chocolaty undertone,1
swift and friendly,1
this museum like,1
great to finally have a delicious bbq joint near by,1
thoroughly impressed with this location,1
great in addition,1
smaller they were quite large,1
friendly as the indian trail,1
free efficient,1
half about getting it right the first time and half about fixing the things that happen when it is not right the first time,1
hot salty soft pretzels stuffed with pepperoni meatballs or sausage for under 3,1
great we just sat and chilled for a few hours,1
similar to real salmon,1

greasy at all,1
quite big and nice,1
very nice and very clean,1
a bit disappointed by the sandwich i ordered,1
home baked,1

as much as all that,1
offended of they,1
salty baked pretzel smell and suddenly you think going to auntie anne s,1
dead wrong,1
easy to find being right on east carson street in the southside of pittsburgh,1
perfectly happy being a stoop dweller and taking up someone else s front steps to eat one of these salty snacks,1
most ideal,1
a potential eye sore,1

decently good,1
due to seasoning and teriyaki sauce,1
able to answer any questions,1
pretty fantastic,1

cute as all heck,1
tacky to try on something and possibly ruin the sweater with any cigar odor,1
utterly bored,1
unprofessional and the,1
so cool that i work here attitude is obnoxious,1
a million ultra high,1
one nice,1
short lived because i was told not to take pictures while waiting for my cousin to scope out a handbag,1

seemingly silly,1
more than poor customer service and a bad attitude,1
industry unforgivable,1
other awesome,1
black on the bottom of the meat,1
not mexican and very gross,1
good for two weeks,1

partially filled,1
really busy and 2 women working,1
decent but not worth,1
ok but nothing more,1
so close to my house,1
a little scary with massive potholes,1

very clean and neat,1
a little early if you decide to go during a busy time,1

better than touti gelati,1
brown in color,1

bad for buffet,1
pretty good for it,1
asian ized american,1

high quality fresh hand rolled,1
picky as,1
friendly to her,1
menu or child sized,1

surprised to find out that i am a fan of the dueling piano bar,1
not so much when it comes to howl at the moon,1
so entertaining about the dueling pianos,1
marginally talented,1

better if we would gotten there earlier and could have sat at a table,1
dirty with dishes left over from the last patrons,1

so watered down i could probably call it noodle soup,1
more than adequate seating it does have a good layout and generally pretty clean considering how some people eat here,1
straight to their sushi,1

nothing impressive,1
gracious professional and extremely competent,1
energy based,1
able to take me from grumpy to happy in 90 minutes,1

sad to see it go,1
alive after five and usually before the real crowd,1
bland and raw,1
totally disgusted in how kat was yelling at her employee,1
rude to her employees,1
friendly smiley and helpful,1
soft and soooo fresh,1
rich creamy and perfect,1
long hard,1
more focused on paella,1

sure your dog has shots there is pee puddles and poop is just sprayed away with a hose possibly onto my feet,1
sure any employees were present because other than the friendly bartender no one is identified as staff,1
least pricey,1
good and strong,1
freash and tasty,1
too long for coffee and donuts,1

undressed in my sweatshirt and yoga sexy pants,1
dorky yet sexy,1
pixie like,1
very attentive as a server very hunky as a man a total dreamboat,1
able to watch the dogs play and run around while you kick back a few drinks lrb which are much more reasonably priced than most of the bars in charlotte rrb,1
particularly happy that they have sashimi,1
other than the thumb twirling,1
really weak,1
tight and disappointed,1
amazed at how much seating and food choices they have in here,1

awful and overpriced,1
accommodating and nice,1
fantastic swedish,1
skilled and friendly,1
efficient and not painful,1
typical facial,1
great my favorite is the agua de fruta the large drink is 270,1
worth every drop ask for no ice and get more,1

great they offer it,1
so close to the door i sometimes get confused about the line,1
very aware,1

pork rind like,1
grey green,1

most tragic,1
good for people,1
super friendly i love my dogs,1
all fresh and delicious,1
so rubbery,1
worst persian,1
nice to have persian food while there,1
dry tastless and low,1
so mad we did not even complain,1
tired of paying a fortune for breakfast and trying to find one that serves something your kids would like,1
american styled egg based,1
so comfy by hanging out there as well,1
still baffled,1
wrong with the orders,1

hard not to go hungover from the debaucheries of the night before in vegas,1
clean and simple,1
friendly and helpful able to make recommendations on dishes to try,1
more pricey,1
pretty good but not exceptional,1
good about keeping beverages refilled,1

generous with the steak and the mozzarella cheese,1
nice and crusty,1
available in every grocery store,1
hot too many,1
delicious with a glazed donut,1
older but definitely better,1
average for a donut shop,1
uncomfortably hot on a scorching day,1
chinese and american,1
super tacky and uncomfortable,1
enough to work there,1
 10 all inclusive,1
better at night,1
more expensive but much better,1
hard to find a better price quality buffet,1
slightly cool,1
light and chewy,1
banana walnut,1
anything special and more,1
open that late,1
awesome food and atmosphere,1
worth some tolerance,1
it 4th,1
ok overall to me,1
nice to have breakfast at 8 pm,1
top it off with white bread with butter,1
scruptous and fresh,1
so happy to see all the wagging tails,1
guilty for not spending more time with my dog,1
guilt free,1
american express,1
nice to get out of the heat and into some retail therapy,1
better than yours,1
more expensive than other tapas places in town,1
too cheesy not crispy enough,1
small and uncomfortable,1
highly unrecommended,1
out of biscuits,1
okay way to tell me when i order instead of telling me after i have paid i ask for extra carmel on my latte but noooooo,1
more detailed or specific about what they have,1
bad for the manager,1
annoyed about it,1
very similar to the wildly popular alino,1
amazing and flavorful,1
unusual in its presentation but possibly the best,1
a bit thick but perfectly chewy,1
not house made,1
able to see other pizzas soon,1
too hot outside for me,1
thinly sliced and very strongly flavored,1
not finger,1
big enough that it would best be split several ways,1
sweet salty sour and fatty,1
supposedly tapa sized,1
not conducive to ordering many dishes if one is dining alone,1
slow at first,1
partially cold,1
very heavy on the fish sauce,1
very heavy on the green onion tops,1
so frustrating,1
well worth a trip if your not,1
comfortable for a leisurely lunch,1
a little thicker than what you get in naples,1
a little disorganized,1
both disappointing,1
able to take a bite,1
good food and a handful,1
good for being on the strip,1
impressed at how busy it was as the line was out the door,1
unique and fantastic,1
authentic and delicious,1
ok service decent,1
thin as a pancake and very small,1
willing to try something new especially something that i would likely not try or stop at on my own,1
new looking and very clean,1
hard to choose,1
loud enough that you had to raise your voice to talk,1
more authentic and varied,1
able to get an actual seat inside,1
brown with ham and mushrooms,1
enough to share with one other person only if you order more than one,1
a bit too tart,1
top and tiny,1
not extraordinary,1
semaine avant,1
difficult to find seating after 10,1
hilariously big,1
surprised to see that cafe ba ba reeba had a lower average rating than firefly on paradise,1
adamant about not going to firefly,1
so damn confusing,1
quite easy to decide,1
sickly sweet,1
fresh and juicy,1
plump and extremely fresh,1
better than at my favorite tapas place in sf zarzuela,1
highly satisfying,1
tired so i just ordered right away,1
pretty obvious,1
cheaper than starbucks,1
a little disappointed the meat had no flavor i felt like it was a little dry for almost 10,1
excellent authentic,1
pecan ice,1
open to the square very nice touch,1
plain gross,1
dirty dirty,1
baked in authentic made in italy wood,1
nicely charred,1
cannoli in a unique deconstructed style delicious,1
plentiful and varied,1
overcooked and so tough,1
dark cold and so depressing,1
great to have a place like the dog bar in charlotte even if you do not have a dog,1
sure your dogs do not have problems with xl dogs like great danes,1
dense and firm,1
unwell after eating here,1
bad giving it a bad rating,1
shy to go back any time soon,1
happy they enjoyed the complete experience,1
weird to me,1
rather amateur,1
personally friendly,1
worst tasting,1
very yummy with a great selection of items,1
too high for what they serve,1
a bit pricey along with a 7 membership fee,1
a once a month,1
quaint yet modern,1
out of your mind,1
friendly in the least,1
hard to find the waitress for refills and such,1
fried or white with the chicken and broccoli so you would think it was included,1
 7 8,1
happy to finish his dish for him,1
large and the price very reasonable for what you get,1
heavier and denser that k creme with less flavor,1
completely drawn to it because it sounds like i will order a bunch of things and still not get full,1
afraid of not getting full,1
kind of bitter,1
very juicy with yummy veggies with it,1
pretty respectable,1
better than rest,1
good and done lrb not limp rrb but not too crispy,1
convinced i care for the sliced sausage,1
flavorful and good,1
just pissed off,1
incredibly unfriendly,1
solid consistent,1
incredibly expansive,1
difficult to navigate,1
very crowded and noisey,1
unable to control the large environment,1
better at a karaoke bar,1
well enough for the price,1
amazing delicious,1
very flavorless,1
kind of cheap to skimp our on,1
bigger than half my hand balled up,1
overpriced considering there,1
so busy with people coming up to the bar,1
good with bacon,1
delicious i will definitely return to this place and recommend it to anyone,1
so painfully unrelated to spanish food,1
the bacon wrapped,1
favorite light and not cloyingly sweet,1
cheap and gross,1
soft and stale,1
best to not be a nancy here,1
a bit too playfull,1
hot as hades,1
third and probably,1
glad dog owners have a place to go if they want,1
very hands on from what we could tell taking orders and going over menu items if you have a question will recommend items based on your likes,1
better i will try the steak next time,1
well owned,1
just nice,1
stupid entitled,1
only hard,1
all super attentive,1
lucky to live nearby,1
a bit dated and the rug a bit worn,1
quite surprised to find great chinese food hidden in downtown medina ohio,1
enjoyable for me,1
a little high in my opinion,1
willing to lose in order to still eat the sushi,1
substantial except for the lasagna which seemed to be more about presentation than anything,1
one server short,1
a depressing,1
part border collie,1
very vocal,1
nice to see a massive heap of fresh fruit come with your meal as opposed to more potatoes more buttered bread or more bacon,1
hard to make any decision at all,1
decent not amazing,1
sure i should have,1
ok but slow,1
fair we wanted to hit the road,1
extremely nice and amazing,1
great and worth,1
worse than starbucks,1
anywhere close to as busy,1
extremely dry and red before going into see her,1
dead inside the store,1
so bitter,1
surprised to see the somewhat low rating,1
freakin good,1
closer to a 3 star rating but the friendliness of the staff the immaculate kitchen and the relatively fast service bumps it,1
delicious as ever,1
not great but not bad,1
guilty leaving him for a night out,1
sweet at all,1
lucky i had some stevia in my purse,1
too slow to confirm this,1
horribly long,1
prompt with the menu,1
rare in a quick serving food joint that is packed,1
sized and excellent,1
bigger than any sushi place i have ever visited across the us including nyc and san francisco,1
soft like butter,1
better in terms of more friendly and attentive waiters,1
lower and higher,1
quite large for tapas,1
decently proportioned,1
a little confusing on the sliders appetizer,1
more clear it states 4 meat sliders for 8,1
a little misleading,1
impressed for a place that specializes in tortas,1
super good sweet tea was on point,1
wood paneled,1
really really nice,1
nice and low,1
wrong with lasagna,1
more than ample,1
loud with screaming kids running around,1
as good as this,1
slightly disappointed after going,1
special or even worth,1
not overly impressed,1
otherwise very detailed,1
averse to them,1
tasty but lighter and smaller,1
worth 109,1
available at the counter,1
very quick for a lunch hour,1
tasty and good,1
roomier than others i have been to so that was a plus,1
delicious as usual,1
wrong with baking in the toppings,1
dumb and rude,1
a little too bright,1
fun hispanic,1
extremely courteous,1
distinct from the other chain beto places in that every meat could be tasted distinctly and not as some meat mash,1
almost reminicent of a creamsicle,1
drop dead,1
able to walk right up to the stage,1
really friendly and attentive without being pushy or annoying,1
wrong with goat cheese tomato sauce and bread,1
way too overpowering,1
very good and please regime flame kabob another chance with him,1
born and white,1
always delish,1
sure if the masseuse was certified for pregnant massages,1
unfocused throughout,1
worth the hassle of driving there let alone the cost,1
clean enough but unfortunately i had heard bad things before,1
a little bored but for the short interaction we had,1
a bit unclean,1
a little cautious of being caught in the middle of one,1
nicer and brighter than the old dark dankness,1
brown and filled,1
happier with this first visit,1
pleasantly surprised at the huge selection of food available,1
able to find plenty to eat,1
unbelievable especially considering the amount of choices of food,1
completly empty of patrons,1
super friendly and amazing,1
happy with my donuts coffee,1
16 oz,1
medium cold,1
40 cents extra,1
sure to be extremely specific so they do not mess up,1
a little rude and disrespectful at times,1
good as are the subs,1
pretty unsanitary,1
casual and fun,1
lrb bad rrb,1
nice of the owner to contact me and to take my bad experience seriously,1
very concerned,1
a little reluctant at first,1
very pleasant and relaxing,1
happy healthy,1
so much worse than larb s version,1
able to grab a few tables in the middle of the room,1
really rude to several of us,1
really silly,1
just friendly about it,1
really goooood,1
aware of the typical crowd,1
not watery,1
unusual in itself,1
very very tasty,1
very well seasoned and yummy,1
clean and shiny in there too and open,1
one available,1
highly impressed with his professionalism and knowledge,1
very relaxing and professional,1
back to the counter untouched to get a refund,1
even easier,1
so happy she suggested it,1
due to poor training rather than lack of personal effort on her part,1
salty and lukewarm,1
annoyed to have been disturbed from running his mouth with members of his staff,1
insane without it,1
awesome and all,1
happy with a tired pup,1
pretty attentive,1
kind of disappointed,1
close to breaking my teeth with the staleness,1
somewhat tasty,1
so enjoyable,1
happy drunk,1
tricky because of the location,1
aware of that,1
darkly lite,1
afraid of the mushroom empanadas they were amazing,1
intimate and calming,1
knowledgeable and caring,1
quite appetizing,1
this nasty,1
very nicer,1
attentive to my family s needs,1
nice with good amount of seating,1
a little cheaper when it comes to dinner and weekend buffet compared to other asian buffet,1
enough to filter the air,1
green like salsa on the condiments,1
friendly and easy,1
super excited to try out this amazing pizza,1
a little steep,1
soooooo thick it must be good,1
super popular,1
safe with the ham and cheese torta lrb part sub panini rrb,1
so airy,1
kind of loud,1
limited and next to tire shop but well worth,1
so safely good,1
fun to order a selection of tapas to share pass,1
sure to also leave room to try the paella which is very tasty,1
too obsessed with the cheese steaks to even try,1
lucky me,1
the most fun,1
all positive,1
available at this price point of restaurant,1
sure there is a bigger and better sushi buffet available in charlotte,1
just that typical,1
that clean,1
already wet,1
very dark and not airy,1
very small and unisex,1
pretty odd,1
better than most buffets,1
next to big lots,1
ill trained,1
otherwise fine,1
hardly possible,1
well made and smooth,1
so tasty and fresh,1
hot and well balanced,1
horrible main dishes were cold,1
hard and old,1
soft sweet and lightly toasted,1
priced and amazing,1
willing to work at keeping your customers happy,1
many take out pizzas of all kinds,1
dry and rubbery,1
advanced for a birthday,1
very nice and very able to accommodate,1
amazing looking,1
overcooked and so so thin,1
poor me,1
so tiny and overcooked,1
so so sugary,1
extremely delicious,1
simple and done,1
oblong shaped and really pretty,1
most excited about the chicken paella,1
new and sparkling clean,1
sure you come just before lunch dinner,1
overly laden with sugar salt or msg,1
so picky about my soup,1
big on buffets,1
completely tortured,1
way too loud,1
a little blown,1
huge portions of most vegas restaurants cafe ba ba reeba was a little place that we found one,1
great we started with half a pitcher,1
inside and 4 tables outside,1
very clean and well cared for,1
well established,1
lightly breaded and slightly spicy,1
delicious frozen,1
totally fair,1
grainy and clearly overcooked,1
super watery,1
just plain gross,1
a bit slow to refill your coffee and to bring the bill,1
incredibly personable warm and friendly,1
significantly less clinical and awkward,1
thorough and fantastic,1
extremely lovely i would and have,1
quite meaty,1
close and alert him,1
ready to my liking,1
relatively low,1
as good as many other places for the money i paid,1
alone soda station salsa bar,1
glad her mood had improved by the end,1
very noticeable that the sushi was made in a rush,1
annoying to me,1
fresh with everything else,1
a little sick,1
much else to type anything more,1
live and very talented,1
small and nothing fancy,1
usually less of a line than whiskey river the forum or cans and a sometimes a less trendy crowd,1
bored one,1
bought at the bakery at a grocery storethey we asked again why we could not get the pink sprinkles,1
surprisingly good inexpensive,1
good though can not say about the customer service,1
local in noda from abari to cabo fish,1
more likely to be told to move your car than you are to be asked if you are interested in learning about the bar,1
much to brag about,1
so low priced,1
helpful with refilling drinks clearing dishes from the table,1
pretty plain with mayo tomatoes and avacado,1
not good enough for such a huge price,1
dated and unimpressive,1
marginally friendly,1
hot and tasty and fairly priced,1
happy and contented,1
very subjective,1
good or great,1
picky about my sushi,1
glad i passed,1

 10 more expensive,1
fantastically memorable,1
new enjoyable,1
phenomenal sounding,1
disappointing as the bland eggrolls,1
terrible but not as good as it is been in the past while dining in the restaurant,1
utterly confused and embarrassed,1
elusive dog,1
a bit tight for all the people who want to come in,1
right in the middle in front of you,1
pretty extensive with specialty drinks,1
awesome and fun,1
a little too helpful,1
incredibly odd,1
sure you are not seated by the waterfall,1
somewhat obnoxious,1
really pushy,1
bigger sized,1
ashamed of yourself charging that much for rice,1
better than other tapas places,1
sure that we will be back any time soon,1
still not sure,1
it good,1
meatball sized,1
slightly crunchy,1
personal sized,1
power hungry,1
early to score a table and avoid the cover,1
really crowded around 9 do not expect to get seats after this unless you play the vulture for your group,1
particularly strong,1
ready to sing along,1
2 3 hour happy,1
special priced,1
super duper nice,1
very attentive to what areas i wanted worked on the most,1
most relaxing and comfortable,1
suitable for everyone,1
all extremely nice and helpful lrb much better than the rooftop place across from it rrb,1
hilarious to listen to,1
visibly wet from dog urine and feces which is just watered down with a hose maybe once a day,1
close to clean,1
aggressive toward puppies that are not neutered yet,1
a much better cleaner,1
greasy unhealthy and strangely enticing,1
better after a night of drinking,1
so immaculate,1
really worthy of only two stars,1
amazing so were the potatoes,1
welcome to pull 36 napkins one at a tine from the dispenser,1
kind of sweet but pretty good,1
much much much better,1
very delicious and southern,1
crazy good,1
well proportioned,1
a lil different,1
impressed enough to write a review until last night,1
sure i was able to get my pup out and about as much as possible,1
tired out at dog bar,1
sure i included it in my review because it only raised my opinion of the dog bar,1
pretty aggressive towards him,1
too worried because of my dog,1
so comforting and helpful,1
well worth stopping in for,1
a little sweet but not overly so,1
very generous with the toppings,1
flaky soft and yeasty,1
sure to bring a few bucks for juke box,1
a little heavy for my taste,1
orange y in color and really just not tasty at all,1
good old american,1
1 beers nice,1
slightly nasty tasting,1
bad for the area,1
fairly inedible,1
tranquil and special,1
higher end but affordable,1
technically very good,1
very thorough and responsive,1
so hot they had to be removed,1
good to say about the manicure,1
spa like,1
very hygienic,1
really fast,1
incredibly strong smelling off brand,1
strong smelling,1
uncomfortable for a manicure,1
somewhat nitpicky,1
every day run of the mill basic,1
fancy or particularly,1
sick from food,1
intentionally rude,1
clearly overwhelmed and inefficient,1
the american,1
cold and rubbery and dry,1
deathly sick right after eating it and for the rest of the day,1
too many other food options to go to,1
bar none better than any,1
proof enough that we love this place,1
just as good as before,1
generally dirty,1
environmental great,1
good food and convenient,1
extremely bad and unpleasant,1
too long to see what i wanted as he was talking on the phone for too long,1
bigger than the rice s portion,1
careful how much you,1
too cakey for me and not many,1
wrong with any menu item,1
cool comfortable and tasteful,1
very popular in the near future with the development of the langtree area,1
worth the scramble for the food,1
really good and our service superb much better,1
seemingly odd,1
less expensive but very enjoyable,1
delightfully drunken,1
egg related,1
fresh and authentic as is the menu,1
upscale casual,1
unfamiliar to a lot of people in the area,1
familiar with the neopolitan concept,1
so glad they did,1
a little concerned over the menu not having a large selection of items and many of the people in our party,1
unable to keep up with refiling of beverages,1
fine for a breakfast joint,1
excited to know that we were going to have a tapas place,1
equal mexican,1
famous for their coffee and every other place,1
less than pleasant,1
difficult to relax,1
very awkward and uncomfortable,1
very annoying to drop 65 on a mani pedi only to get home,1
totally impressed,1
helpful and prompt,1
freshly baked right before you,1
4 5 star worthy,1
desperate for some food,1
so different than what i have tasted before,1
tasty unique,1
really late,1
warm and sincere,1
late in her shift,1
surprising for both of us,1
just different,1
borderline perfect,1
excellent at her job,1
a little better than the others,1
smooth and glowing,1
so hung up on integers,1
a bit salty,1
hot in charlotte in july,1
so very hot in charlotte in july,1
only cream,1
pretty trashy in that area,1
real busy at noon,1
ready to stand in line,1
ready and willing,1
incredibly courteous,1
hygienic as they make you believe,1
big and small,1
rambunctious and calm,1
amazing super fresh and perfectly made not too oily or overdone,1
extremely disappointed by this tapas bar,1
absolutely amazing and refreshing,1
much more energized yet calm after each session,1
out of something else,1
self nice,1
better than a lot of other restuarants,1
favorite out of all charlotte clubs,1
fun young,1
totally sobering,1
average and not memorable,1
overwhelmed by work i schedule an appointment here for a very relaxing and enjoyable experience,1
easy to make a reservation,1
willing to make the drive to this spa in particular as i always get incredible service and feel relaxed when walking out the door,1
definitely acceptable,1
no rice available at the moment,1
big and thick,1
less than stellar lrb enter sushi,1
overcooked and tough,1
so glad we did and we will definitely be back on another trip i had the all star breakfast with raisin toast and grits i have never had grits before but very,1
very friendly and welcoming thank you for a great experience and yummy food,1
unnecessarily rude to my bachelorette,1
bad enough that we felt it was necessary to speak to the manager jim,1
great for sporting events,1
chronically slow at putting this food out especially the sashimi,1
tough a hybrid,1
far thicker than they should be because they are cutting the fish to maximize the volume,1
chinese mongolian japanese,1
typical of any place that offers all three,1
heavily breaded and deep,1
typical for these types of places they open strong,1
lower on any dish,1
easy to schedule an appointment,1
wrong on the website,1
facial on their website,1
so positive,1
awesome do not have these at home always,1
pleasant cook was well trained,1
good for a buffet,1
so obviously dark,1
so crisp as to be hard,1
light in color,1
okay with it,1
able to have a conversation with my wife,1
fancy good comfort food better than fast food,1
full after her 2 rolls that she ordered,1
great plum spicy,1
greasy at all and fresh veggies,1
sweet fruity and very refreshing,1
lighter and fresher,1
good but very heavy,1
alright by me,1
canine friendly,1
friendly and sociable,1
happy to go in his honor every once in a while to grab a beer and give some love to the neighborhood pooches,1
ready for the president to arrive and dine,1
extremely friendly not pushy offered a sample of their homemade chicken soup while i was deciding,1
undecided between two menu items,1
not to expensive,1
food taste great,1
incredibly underwhelming,1
very familiar with pad thai,1
familiar with the flavors,1
extremely kind and professional,1
spacious enough to accompany my huge family,1
so different than other wings at other buffets,1
half that bad for buffets,1
a little more fresh,1
gruesome looking,1
nothing more than tortillas i could of gotten from walmart,1
worth 17 even after you,1
crisp and just taste wonderful with the green peppers and baby tomatoes,1
hectic in the restaurant,1
too far from my house,1
hard to make a coffee with out cream and sugar,1
a little closer to every other day which is a bummer for those of us who remember it being built,1
enough to make me go back,1
good enough for me to want again,1
people watching,1
renowned for their steak subs,1
superior to anything on the menu,1
not so sure,1
good authentic italian,1
very impressed with the pianist and their lyrical abilities,1
way crowded,1
available to coordinate the crowd listening and hanging out,1
super helpful and cool,1
glad i went here instead of the other place i go to around school,1
over cool,1
surprisingly clean and neat,1
indoor and outdoor,1
bad about this place,1
correct it was sesame,1
100 skeptical,1
totally greasy and bad,1
light on the sauce,1
even anything spectacular,1
pretty big and clean,1
nice and knowledgeable,1
a little pricey compared to my regular kabob,1
very cheap and low,1
so tender flavorful and delicious,1
very skeptical,1
fresh and halal,1
very important for us,1
delicious and not expensive,1
even more relaxing,1
bored at another lesser more human dominated bar in the noda vicinity,1
so watered down we just sipped on them until the place closed,1
super excited about it,1
excited to go back,1
sure to shout out to darius for giving me one of the most amazing massages i have ever had,1
top notch and so warm,1
away from this one far away,1
pleasantly surprised to have good sushi and asian food in this part of the country,1
very surprising,1
very pleasant they even knew the names of their own local patrons the cook willing and outgoing fun to deal with,1
a little surprising,1
quiet and low,1
perfect for a quiet brunch over conversation,1
bad for that particular store and really damaging,1
bad at all good enough,1
awful and disgusting,1
unacceptable on so many levels,1
outside really no,1
important to your business that you can not properly serve your paying customers,1
sure homeless people are allowed,1

greasy cheap,1
italian like,1

passionate about dogs,1
cool their dogs are always with them,1
solid to the entrance,1
sesame general,1
not fussy about quality,1
good and the service excellent,1
due to both my moms boyfriend and i,1
truly local,1
open in chicago,1
better than enjoying a pitcher beer special while my dogs get to run around and be social,1
greedy in regards,1
really nice and very helpful,1
massage facial,1
a chocolate facial,1
right before closing,1
really unimpressive,1
a little dark and gloomy for a breakfast place,1
really rushed and not as service oriented,1
okay for a restaurant to just provide the bare minimum service for a typical come order serve food timely and give,1
just depressing,1
hopeful for a great brunch,1
pretty hesitant to eat raw fish from a buffet,1
lower than average,1
sensitive to my individual requests,1
harder than other massage locations,1
dark with candles and very low lighting,1
more mature and calm,1
strong i do not remember her name but she had black hair,1
drunk for an affordable price,1
helpful to so many of the tipsy woman in there,1
good to use for a party of two or more,1
horrible too,1
relaxed friendly,1
good too bad they did not want to serve me,1
amazing i do not understand negative reviews such a great spot with authentic food loved it,1
picky about tapas,1
fast courteous,1
kind of funny,1
friendly and easy going very diverse crowd there is no cool factor thus making it a very cool bar,1
heavy handed,1
very satisfied with my decision,1
really more like a small loaf of garlic bread,1
perfect for making little lasagna sandwich bites with the garlic bread that i so thoroughly enjoy doing,1
heavy in years,1
overly frozen frosted,1
so excited to find a great pizza,1
really iranian because the general public,1
too stupid,1
soo full,1
crowded so,1
unimpressed with,1
when not busy,1
sure i have everything,1
sure it is more for ambiance,1
plastic cheap,1
hard to cut,1
so dry and bland,1
sure 10 is an opening price because it is so amazing,1
impressed every time with the variety and freshness of sushi and sashimi,1
drunk enough,1
more for big dogs,1
able to watch the pizza makers craft their edible art next to the wood burning stoves,1
the other smaller,1
convenient to our hotel reasonably priced,1
apparently acclaimed for their many benedict style egg dishes,1
plain old hollandaise,1
magical as the rhapsody,1
most indulgent,1
local to me,1
very easy to use,1
ready to take me back,1
 custom facial,1
good but not extraordinary,1
so sad because 4 years ago i ate at babareeba in chicago and had such an amazing experience,1
great food and very knowledgeable,1
rounded meal option left and we will have to give up what was one of our favorite places to eat,1
so welcoming and helpful,1
a busy,1
good as this one for the pizza,1
juicy and flavorful,1
cheap for a buffet,1
old lrb for the food items that a lot of people do not get rrb and cold,1
old they just add the fresh and hot food and mixed it with the old food,1
pale and dead,1
disgusting dethawed,1
memorable in the least,1
classic to the style of the,1
all but not awesome,1
more treated like a person and not just another customer,1
glad i got to come check out this place in langtree,1
overly impressed with the food,1
a bit pricey for the size lrb in comparison to alino s where you pay 22 for a pizza that is 2 3x the size rrb,1
very cute and open love,1
a little overpriced for the quality of the food,1
nostalgic for the old place,1
short in other places,1
the most personable,1
very musically inclined,1
amazing at making sounds,1
pretty damn quick at making sandwiches,1
sure i was not at a jimmy johns,1
pretty impressed on all the flavors i was getting from the torta,1
sure others have had different experiences here,1
somewhat picky because i most often would use massage heights,1
friendly yet professional,1
great to be able to schedule online,1
sweet and juicy,1
more important than the food quality,1
more occupied with literally everyone else in the restaurant except ours,1
pretty pricey for the quality,1
calm and soothing,1
easy to pick up on the way,1
too much for what you got,1
able to fold and form a sandwich around the small pellets of falafel and lettuce tomato also,1
great for the falafel,1
way above average brownish in color inside hot small and well spiced,1
better than this,1
picky when it comes to pizza this place deserves 5 stars from me,1
cozy not expensive and family owned,1
happy it took my gyro virginity,1
pretty substantial,1
especially polite,1
good despite the place being pretty full,1
funny very engaging and very talented,1
as bad as some and in a 24 hour breakfast joint like this,1
a lil newer and cleaner,1
perfect for a hot meal on the go,1
overcooked the steaks,1
typically good,1
rude and unhelpful and somewhat offensive,1
middle aged,1
twenty something year old,1
ready to sing along and enjoy the music,1
a bit pricey but affordable,1
so relaxed pampered,1
great at home,1
fresh and clear,1
totally hilarious,1
able to partake in the fun here,1
free to roam about the fenced in bar,1
very casual not pretentious,1
extremely limited even more,1
very light on the sauce,1
good and inexpensive,1
great for yelping,1
very simple and delicious,1
almost as good as mine,1
super fast and friendly,1
much more expensive on the menu 699 chicken vs 899 lamb,1
lackluster at best,1
so minimal,1
fresh and ready to be eaten,1
very delicious and very close,1
really tanked,1
exceedingly long,1
friendly and very good at what they do,1
sooo excited,1
yummy and sooo savory,1
super overpriced,1
pissed off the entire time i was eating it,1
soooooo disappointed,1
great and super plain,1
popular tuesday,1
tasty happy,1
sure to ask about their specialty rolls,1
undercooked and doughy,1
fresh with good flavor combo,1
trendy and upscale,1
great tired,1
pretty standard and not very difficult,1
fantastic but tolerable,1
great with an ample selection of raw cooked and nonfish rolls,1
great with mixed greens eggs fruit etc,1
close to uncc next,1
we sure about this,1
chinese japanese and american,1
hard to leave this place and not feel like you got your money s worth,1
able to survive,1
fine but not worth,1
most attentive,1
absolutely delightful,1
lucky to compare one waffle house to another in tennessee that i went to,1
less enamored of the dog bar,1
chilled out a bit,1
simply perfect,1
available to hose,1
closer to home in ballantyne,1
really great for not just the dogs but the humans too,1
legit tired for the next 3 days its a great way for her,1
great except you do sometimes get people who openly admit to not liking dogs and then get mad when one of them jumps on them,1
good about cleaning up after the dogs,1
generous serving,1
able to finish it after a delicious meal,1
so light,1
great for what it is great for,1
inside is beautiful,1
hard to get past worrying that by the time you get home,1
crazy for their white sangria,1
great and really enough to share,1
pretty fresh to me but pretty basic,1
completely exhausted,1
right in the parking lot,1
uptight with dogs playing running and barking then,1
pretty tasteless and disappointing,1
extra cheesy,1
even bussy,1
better than hunan,1
a little overwhelmed by the never ending lunch crowd,1
often burnt out,1
weird as crappy,1
crazy about location,1
too fried,1
just dry,1
somewhat arrogant,1
not shocked,1
abhorrent in almost every way,1
too impressed with the food,1
entirely empty,1
really fatty gristly,1
valid for take out,1
sketchy looking,1
a little overwhelming,1
fun to see what is up and have couple of beers and wings,1
ready to do some,1
lovingly made,1
loud and boisterous,1
decidedly too little,1
not areal,1
ready to finish her role as talking person,1
styro containers smaller,1
virtually empty,1
so average,1
kind and calm and technically very talented,1
welcome kind,1
not sure about the meat to me,1
out of waffles,1
well worth it because it was one of the best meals i have had in a long time,1
available as their lone healthy option,1
kind of excited,1
very refreshing but not sure it was worth,1
clean busy,1
reasonably priced made fresh to order and absolutely delicious,1
sure you ask for a side of the pickled onions jalapenos and carrots lrb they are free rrb,1
large and good,1
insanely talented,1
young to middle aged professionals,1
classy but casual,1
too long to write this that her name slipped my mind,1
so comfortable on my first visit,1
hard to find a kubideh place that is any good my new kabob spot in vegas,1
nothing worse than forced fun,1
atmosphere crowded yet spacious,1
slightly older,1
mostly high,1
similar to other epicentre,1
unique to this setting,1
surprisingly interesting,1
 black and yellow,1
mostly due to the company and the musicians willingness,1
even able to carry a tune,1
extremely reasonable by vegas standards,1
huge great for people watching,1
wrong with people,1
all very pleased,1
delicious and portioned,1
so large that two of us could not finish,1
very pleasant nonrushed,1
less than enthusiastic,1
not so good and still overpriced,1
now much more efficient,1
ready to quit,1
nominally short of the requirement,1
just ok for a buffet,1
happy hour before having a seat in the dining area,1
awesome about this place,1
ashamed of the reviewers,1
thankful and overjoyed to welcome novanta,1
would be,1
extremely friendly and gracious,1
sore for the eyes,1
cute and well appointed,1
neither hot nor cold,1
neither strong nor weak,1
so tender and succulent,1
casual but elegant,1
worth saving some room for,1
slightly larger than a 99 hamburger,1
totally delivered,1
a little worried about the quality,1
pizza hot,1
freeze dried,1
sure my diet pepsi was refilled,1
fat and happy,1
all really friendly and knowledgeable,1
pretty relaxing,1
sure about any of the other services,1
better than the peach sangria,1
asthetically pleasing and pretty sure,1
regular farted,1
right next,1
very cheap and quick,1
glad to know that they are there,1
consistent and the service alway polite and attentive without being pushy,1
a little extra,1
overpriced for what they are,1
more soggy if that,1
special in langtree,1
too keen on chinese buffets,1
broke college,1
willing to help me custom order a dish to my liking,1
best authentic,1
amazing i would and will be going back,1
hard to find around here,1
really great at targeting the spots that needed extra attention,1
little to no space for walkways,1
very clogged on crowded nights,1
facial that i have had in pittsburgh,1
enough to get their machine fixed,1
long to get it fixed can only imagine how much money they are losing,1
fresh and cooked perfectly,1
a little disappointed i was not offered any refreshment before beginning my treatments,1
a solid ok,1
really mixed,1
terrible cluttered,1
definitely not conducive to a relaxing or pampering experience,1
pleasant and chatty,1
sure to bring cash if you decide to dine here,1
very specific at times,1
yummy were mixed right,1
much better if he had a hand,1
toasty warm throughout our meal,1
low on sangria,1
definitely disappointed,1
bland and little,1
slightly cooler than the 105 outside but hot enough to make me miss my car,1
quite good just very expensive,1
unbelievably friendly,1
special every night,1
nice for us,1
very shy at first,1
nicely behaved,1
able to go out to a bar and bring your dog with you,1
decent american,1
dog bar you are welcome with or with out,1
smiley efficient and helpful,1
more fruity and sweet,1
more red,1
good crispy,1
slow moving,1
super funny and knowledgable,1
so smart,1
impressed with the food and the quality,1
happy about,1
much different from their other restaurants which offer ny style,1
much to compare it to,1
straight out of italy,1
all shocked at how good this was,1
very happy with what we saw,1
so excited to try this place as we kept hearing about it,1
a bit hesitant,1
superior in their other establishments,1
first open,1
a bit harsh as this place has not even been opened for 2 weeks,1
quick and delish,1
full satisfying,1
twice we,1
pancakes bagels tried,1
great they have large combination breakfasts that we were able to share between two people the latte was great fresh squeezed orange juice was also good service was very friendly nice location spacious large benches to sit on prices,1
good for the quality and amount of food,1
uncomfortable and pressured to order from the way she was staring with a very serious face like she just wanted me to hurry up,1
ever disappointed,1
good and fond,1
even nice,1
exciting crowded lively,1
club like,1
well enough to carry on a conversation,1
rather expensive,1
deeply disappointing,1
so dismissive,1
 ok without apologizing for wasting so much of our time,1
this juicy and flavorful,1
not many,1
better than tutti frutti,1
super cool and cozy,1
great as is the toasted caesar salad,1
too salty to have a bite,1
different from the typical italian new york or chicago,1
the most friendly,1
appropriate and adequate,1
thoroughly displeased,1
delicious and cheap definitely not healthy,1
beautiful clean well lit,1
chinese american and japanese,1
very well,1
pretty clean for a buffet cheap too,1
plain and dull,1
crisp or unique,1
rather snubbed,1
rather cold,1
not easy,1
mushroom empanada bacon wrapped,1
astonished that it has actually gotten worse,1
weak and tasteless,1
too nasty,1
okay for drinks and tapas,1
good as mama ricotta s,1
fine with the small,1
cheaper than a small,1
so doughy and gross,1
cheap happy,1
other than the fact that the restaurant has awesome affordable specials,1
spectacular about this place,1
a little stuffy for a tapas place,1
ridiculously dark,1
impatient and not friendly,1
only a quarter full,1
so rushed,1
good for a hot vegas afternoon,1
hot the tomatoes were halved cherry tomatoes rather than diced,1
coconut cake soaked in a rum,1
softer and slightly higher,1
great for what style it is and truly lives by its name neapolitan pizza,1
incredibly personable,1
highly impressed,1
ok with me,1
so warm,1
tasty and soft,1
free for grabs,1
much of a sandwich person,1
clean any bar,1
sure to give any human that dares to walk in here food in hand the group stare down because they just ought to know better,1
full even before the paella arrived,1
sure to get there relatively early if you want a guaranteed table,1
pretty varied,1
pretty casual,1
glad to know it was a crowd pleaser,1
as sweet,1
sweet bread is good too,1
fresh as possible,1
fine ok do not come back,1
sorry for the confusion,1
most strange,1
perfectly made,1
good quality and fresh,1
mediocre and not very welcoming,1
reasonable for brunch,1
came on mondays special buck 50 waffle special,1
good extra crispy,1
just a tad bigger,1
other than that it was good,1
hot and funny,1
strong and stiff and the food was great,1
too sweet to eat,1
hard to find the restaurant because you have take downward steps to get to it,1
clean and big,1
really cold,1
meat good,1
hard to imagine that you can get breakfast wrong,1
worse than a microwave meal,1
very wobbly,1
cold soggy and uncooked,1
good about the dish,1
better than any take out chinese food,1
glad i have found a place up here that my dog and i enjoy,1
cluttered and dirty,1
hard for even someone picky to,1
good and fresh and hot,1
amazing i have never seen such a section,1
tiny thin,1
clear i am only disappointd in their sandwhiches,1
large clean friendly and open late,1
much nicer of a location than the one on baseline i 10,1
very feng shui,1
able to walk in and get seated at 1045 am,1
surprised to see green tea flavor,1
quite as crunchy as a french fry,1
nice for the few interactions,1
nice to be around so many like minded,1
so happy to be at work meeting other dog lovers,1
harder to notice when there are tons of cute pups friendly people around,1
pretty spotty,1
so meh,1
very caring and friendly,1
more familiar,1
full of holes,1
so thrilled,1
overly creepy,1
far more than just pizza plenty of pasta can be found on the menu and sandwiches as well,1
careful if you order the pasta,1
so hot in fact that you will burn the roof off your mouth and the cheese will sear your brain so that you can not taste anything for a week,1
many like this around any longer,1
sure if the store front closes early lrb like some mcd or starbucks rrb,1
at least comparable to shinto which is popular in strongsville up the road,1
pretty good for the price,1
impressed at the availability of hoses lrb for obvious reasons rrb water bowls and decorative fire hydrants,1
pretty cool with what i can only describe as tall two seater adirondack chairs around the patio perimeter and some high top table and picnic style tables in the middle on top of astro turf,1
mostly local,1
very happy with the massage service i have received at evolve,1
really good in working with me on longer term issues lrb eg posture rrb and ensuring that i still find the massage relaxing,1
much fussed about atmosphere,1
impressed with the high end feel,1
pretty complicated,1
better at 7 11 or even winchels,1
all happy,1
very inexpensive and very tasty,1
your pit looking,1
worth the drama with a rambunctious dog,1
necessarily cheap,1
normal to see pizzas snacks,1
bored at home,1
obligated to purchase booze to go to this bar,1
anywhere nice,1
muddy drooly,1
bad about it,1
exciting enough for your pooch,1
large sized,1
really crowded near the gate,1
more likely to get jumped on if you linger around,1
free to get the dogs paws off the bar if you do not want it near you or please break up any humping that may happen even if its not your dog,1
hard to always see your dog so if another dog poops near you it would be swell if you could scooper it quick so,1
better than cleaning it off your dog later,1
previously dirty,1
really excessive,1
easily accessible and usually delicious,1
complete and objective,1
just so nice stylish,1
way good,1
full of nascar junkies and hand to mouth wage slaves and right wing zealots,1
rare and delightful,1
hard by the town,1
very very mild,1
a bit loud,1
closer and closer,1
very much hit,1
quick but warm friendly,1
different but wonderful,1
wrong with their pizza,1
wood fired,1
perfectly crispy on the outside no soggy crust,1
homemade and divine,1
thought out served with a side of espresso to soften the ice cream and add a unique flavor,1
very careful and well thought,1
good as well,1
especially friendly,1
fantastic as was their corn and green chili soup,1
out of them,1
awesome enough to have them prepare a batch,1
fresh for me,1
so long as i did not mind waiting a little longer for them to prep it,1
picky about the facility and therapists,1
both technically great,1
professional and very friendly,1
extraspecial for us,1
amazing for frequent fliers,1
more clinical,1
slightly sweet but tangy too,1
sure to stop in for lunch or dinner,1
casual but slightly more upscale,1
suitable for a date,1
fortunate enough to have a table in the bar are,1
both entertaining and quite comfortable,1
zen like,1
good consistant and good,1
able to put a quality product out to her best,1
ok friday evening lrb 8 pm ish rrb and i can understand trying to cut corners on expenses by letting a server go but never cut,1
unable to get the orders correct product out to the customers nor clean up,1
awesome amazing handsome,1
very sick after going here so i have to subtract 2 stars,1
susceptible to getting sick,1
overthetop good,1
open until 10 or 11,1
too nauseas lrb pregnancy related rrb to enjoy the food,1
very bustling with family and kids,1
more romantic and sexy,1
dark red and black with quiet groovy like music in background,1
best i think if you want to just sit and learn more about each other over cocktails,1
chummy with some local guys,1
pointless for me,1
ok but too wet,1
more crispy,1
not all,1
ok to dress casual or dressy,1
much better for family,1
mostly chinese and some american mexican,1
only japanese,1
even good,1
incorrect 95,1
bad giving them only three stars,1
brand spankin new,1
wonderful and extremely professional,1
memorable about the service,1
great specially if you are wondering the fashion show mall,1
kind of stupid,1
aware of scams,1
aware to always look at your receipt,1
fully aware of the rules regulations,1
low grade due to unsanitary conditions,1
able to eat here,1
filthy and unsanitary,1
accountable or responsible,1
significantly weaker than the second,1
visibly agitated,1
compulsive about them,1
really strange,1
kind of bad,1
always super,1
very limited and simple,1
fast attentive,1
usually very slow,1
worse if the person in front of you,1
very clean and awesome,1
nervous in crowds,1
so pleased with their food,1
of course famished,1
crazy if you do not,1
very spicy salty,1
very high in fat grams carbs,1
way too expensive for what you order,1
sad to see so few dunkin locations in vegas so after this location opened up lrb near me rrb,1
great to try something new in there,1
a little enthused about being there,1
great being right on the square in an older building,1
consistent and very tasty very fresh,1
best and most relaxing,1
complete with creaky floors and funny drapes,1
super knowledgeable and helpful,1
great since its,1
excited to try this place out and hopefully write a good review later,1
the house special,1
very tasting,1
most foul,1
similar to bacon,1
professional as always,1
mediocre at best the service,1
right on medina square,1
thoroughly satisfied,1
fun expansive,1
very impressed with our drink service,1
better than sbux,1
really close,1
great for a lunch meal,1
eye widening,1
ok enough to say you have had a well balanced breakfast,1
sure you watch where you step to go down the spiral staircase,1
so needless to say,1
sure i purell my whole body after that,1
very nice and private,1
small that is near the building,1
rowdy after hours,1
obvious they were not smoking cigarettes,1
too obvious,1
loudly proclaimed,1
rowdy high,1
full of dirty dishes,1
nice late night,1
maybe spicy,1
wrong with the new york city roll,1
very tranquil,1
out of my pay grade,1
sure it was there,1
absolutely inedible,1
moist or soft,1
sour and not ripe,1
great not horrible,1
good but with the pizza being so small the amount of crust leaves very,1
same somewhat bland in flavor,1
good baked,1
sure to print out those passes,1
very inclusive,1
hard to get a table because they host a lot of parties,1
wrong with going up to the front of the stage with your drink to get a better view,1
back double,1
able to hear them,1
incredibly dirty,1
good one,1
genuinely glad,1
very disappointed by the lack of customer service and professionalism,1
unwilling to modify my massage in any way doing just arms legs or feet etc,1
really disgusting,1
a bit too much,1
more sugary,1
more likely to lose money in the short term as they are giving away food,1
acceptable in the short term,1
abysmal and just down right spooky at time at how quiet it is,1
more appropriate,1
able to sit outside in the middle of february,1
sure you order enough quantity for your table,1
very disappointed to have to pay for a lousy meal,1
good for a breakfast place,1
great except for natalie,1
hard dry and cold,1
food lrb because dogs rrb but fun,1
super cheesy,1
definitely more of a fork and knife kind of pizza not a thin foldable slice,1
good old fashioned cheesy down home,1
a bit pulpy for my liking,1
good satisfying,1
ready to use the spanish,1
ready to take a picture when they do,1
really rocking,1
pretty good buffet joint by far,1
very huge,1
a little less heavy on the calorie side,1
enough wonderful,1
so friendly not to mention all the great pups,1
sure they are killing it with novanta,1
eager to find out if the vegas location lived up to the hype,1
much stronger,1
about right on,1
awesome not,1
overcooked and gummy,1
alive before it is too late,1
crazy filled,1
dissatisfied with the overall flavor of the food,1
absolutely uncalled for,1
better than what it is,1
okay but not nearly big enough,1
prohibitive for what you get,1
pretty sure they were owned by the same owners as brooklyn boys pizza in mooresville,1
close to new york,1
dark and rustic and very comfortable,1
very nicely decorated,1
simple and beautiful in design,1
very good it was mozzarella which they make in house basil and some meat,1
pretty tall,1
sad that they were closed or so long,1
so happy to hear they reopened so i can enjoy my large chicken strips sub with ranch on the side,1
just ridiculous to take 20 min in the drive thru and have one person i front of me will not come back here,1
easy enough to push it to the side,1
raw on the inside,1
angry that i have to pay for this,1
pissed and hungry,1
much better tastier and really good,1
easily offended,1
able to just close my eyes and relax in silence the entire time and feel totally comfortable,1
utterly filthy,1
many in,1
glad to find and indulge in a small koolata,1
hard to get a seat,1
contemporary and appealing,1
a little overfried but still good,1
very familiar with pizza in the style of naples,1
well executed,1
good but dried out,1
cozy but spacious classy but still casual,1
enough to be comfortable,1
adventurous and the,1
mildly adventurous with the seafood,1
able to walk away from a meal feeling better than i have both times i have visited,1
good as was the side sauces n rice,1
warm n delicious,1
savory and sweet,1
difficult to choose just one item,1
perfect for my hangover,1
fancy or unexpected,1
simple and perfect,1
rather high,1
easy to take home,1
sure i liked it,1
slightly smaller,1
hard to do for an 8 pizza,1
hard to taste albeit find,1
easy to give the experience a 1,1
possible to rank it minus,1
glad i did buy the groupon,1
treatment used,1
healthier than the usual american style,1
much less satisfying,1
layered on after the pizza is removed from the oven not actually cooked with the pizza,1
only hard to eat,1
guilty about leaving said dog at home while having a beer but i do not like constantly having to untangle my dog from her leash while tied to a table,1
imaginative and fun to look at,1
afraid i am a creature of habit when it comes to asian foods,1
busy in the mornings,1
decent but not overly friendly or welcoming,1
sure you are not in a hurry if you decide to stop by this location,1
a bit stingy,1
bad at all for what we ordered,1
hey if no one else is going to suggest a song,1
ready to sing along dance or just bob your drunken head to the music,1
quick with the clean,1
careful on the way down a few drinks in you might have you careening off the top level,1
warm and inviting,1
just simply amazing,1
clean and upbeat,1
cheap but quite good,1
nasty crueler,1
anywhere close to my order,1
rude and aloof,1
super eggspensive,1
most eggscruciating,1
sick from the food but not sure,1
happy to not see any issues break out between any of the dogs,1
slimy and old looking,1
totally disappointed in this dunkin,1

cheap quick,1
just speechless that instead of offering an apology about the lack of costumer service of his people he decided to insult us and denigrate small shops and yeah i should have gone to a small quick lube because i am sure,1
better than the service,1
similar to the chipotle method of orderring,1

not very memorable,1
stale bland,1
free lrb i thought they were green bell peppers rrb,1
very pleasantly surprised to say nachos do not have to be fiery and spicy to be tasty,1
nothing more than a fleeting memory of the past,1
totally scrumptious,1
famous for a reason,1
a spicy as the jarred variety,1
tiny but fairly tasty,1
too much that sets it,1
extremely high for the portion size,1
hungry and annoyed,1

interested in other items on the menu such as the lobster roll and raw oysters,1

enough to just chill,1
salty enough as saturday,1
old reliable,1
close to 10 years,1
really sticky,1
amazed at how many thoughtful people must have came before me who believed in recycling utensils for the next guy to sit down,1
not deserving of their thoughtfulness,1
large heaping portions,1
too smoky,1
bad for me,1
inappropriate for my babies,1
clear of the tv,1
easy to get an appointment there,1
hapless patronage of this wannabee carwash,1
only concerned with his ie getting a bigger ticket,1
ready i walked around it briefly and to my shock and surprise,1
short i had to grab a rag myself and clean off some of the more noticeable areas of my car,1
extremely valuable,1
mike grime s response to my email sent saturday at 1053 pm,1
obviously valuable,1
welcome at any of my locations,1
shoddy and mediocre,1

easy to order receive your food,1
open space,1
so honest and friendly,1
clear of this outfit,1

stear clear if you like your car,1
nonsizzling with the lrb 5 small strips of rrb chicken simultaneously overcooked and not warm,1
overoptimistically ridiculous,1
vs large,1
surprised to see i was being charged more for additions because i have not had hat previously,1
really aggravating,1
similar to when i have ordered a small regular,1
sad to have to do this,1
more necessary than ever,1
horrible expensive,1
sure to check out the attached art gallery and arcade for a little added fun while sipping on your beer,1
cruel to keep this place just for myself,1
so good i literally came back for dinner,1
able to find a better coconut mojito than i have had here,1
super big,1
grateful for their ability to fix my exhaust problem at very little cost,1
nice to have someone not try to sell you unneeded repairs,1

disrespectful of me,1
accountable for both of their disrespect,1
lrb small rrb,1
half priced from 4 pm 7 pm,1
the happy hour special,1
huge i would recommend the large for an average sized meal,1
comfortable and confident,1
so thoroughly they ended up replacing a fuel cap i did not even know was broken lrb now it clicks rrb,1
less pretentious,1
so happy i found it,1
2500 poorer than i was before,1
more interested in getting an upsell on the ticket than what i was requesting to be cleaned,1
pregame for sure,1
rude rude rude,1
very friendly and funny,1
impressed with the prompt service,1
typical with what you would find at a car wash place,1

nominal for the labor involved,1
knowledgable about the products or services,1

most economical,1
booked through vacations hawaii which provides you with a meal voucher for breakfast lunch dinner and speciality,1
stupid sexist,1

totally overwhelming,1
if safe,1
particularly pleasant,1
needless to say my tuesday night white russian,1
as bad as the friday night white russian,1
happy middle,1

annoyed with the whole thing,1
7 months pregnant,1
short of how bad the experience was,1
disgusted by it,1

great to see just a bite of of spice for my taste,1
reasonable for the portion,1
friendly fast and accurate,1
also good clean with people coming around to help clear tables,1
really inconsistent with their wings,1
bone dry,1
thrilled to see a barros just down the road,1
way better than pretty much any other chain,1
white with ricotta tomato,1
hard to fathom a manager approaching someone sitting in the bar area watching a football game if they are expecting more people to come,1
sure i delete it immediately cuz he did not want me using it again,1
available at this sports bar for the games,1
able to accept cash payments,1
highly dubious,1
fun watching him spit out the cilantro it was his first time tasting it and did not know what it was,1
sure cilantro is universally loved by kids,1
small but fresh,1
enough melted,1
fresh but so much better,1
white with tattoos,1
unavailable to file a complaint,1
equivalent of a motel 6,1
passionate about delivering exceptional guest experiences,1
bad to start off with,1
ok the service was ok,1
right beside me,1
nice and bright at the front cozier towards the back,1
super generous,1
highly visible amongst the hand written taps on the chalkboard,1
surprised to see they had a promo called mama mondays,1
more for the price,1
okay with the higher price point,1
particularly creative,1
the largest,1
so smooth and velvety,1
nice some restaurants try to rush you out,1
fair they do warn you it is a child friendly environment,1
other than that friendly staff cute atmosphere,1
great for students,1
clear they care about customer satisfaction,1
hard not to get grandma s butter,1
excited for partying,1
moody and brady,1
ready to be served on a plate,1
sure it is not sitting still,1
ready to be refilled,1
a little creepy and disturbing in the restaurant,1
good for a snack but not a place,1
too stuffy,1
wrong with the pig,1
more satisfying than deep fried potatoes smothered in cheese and dark brown deliciousness,1
similar to the works from new york fries,1
strangely elaborate,1
equivalent to tubby dog,1
all very friendly and informative,1
wrong with this choice,1
most picky,1
good consistent,1
negative than positive,1
too negative,1
great coffee lrb te aro locally roasted and delish rrb,1
wide and interesting lrb spiced,1
gluten free baked,1
really happy to see you in the neighbourhood,1
a bit basic,1
better than any type of bertos,1
brightly colored,1
enough to convince you,1
calm and serene with a wonderful aroma,1
sure to request johny he was thorough fun,1
super clean relaxing,1
so fantastic,1
sure he is free before you come down here,1
beautiful clean,1
so stoned,1
too strong she could not even drink it,1
excellent by the bottle,1
afraid to try it because all the rest of the food was cold,1
afraid of salmonella,1
decent fast,1
coffee very important for a cafe,1
actually warm,1
sorry you came here,1
very accommodating to our dietary requirements,1
really bright as compared to the warmly lit bar area,1
distractingly bright,1
solid 45 stars,1
definitely supertasty,1
decently large,1
yummy not overly salty and full of large chunks of chicken and okra and sausage,1
amazed at the sheer number of chunks of meat or okra,1
paper lined,1
large enough that i saved half of it for part of my breakfast on saturday,1
worth the money tasty as all get out,1
fast and fresh,1
good but not good enough to make up for the lack of customer service,1
numbingly bad,1
very professional and informative with everything,1
plain hot,1
willing to even try the combinations this particular food truck was offering much less see which other trucks were at the festival,1
full just so everyone could see what they missed,1
true to that,1
best warm,1
good not excellent,1
top rather than mixed,1
good enough to order from again,1
virtually every,1
bigger than most restaurants,1
adequate enough that you will not be hitting other people,1
less familiar with the sports bar dining section,1
solid in terms of creativity,1
unique and interesting,1
likely more,1
sure it is worth it,1
good for 5 full pints,1
as well as 16oz and 32oz,1
considerably hotter with the sauce,1
solid in the aspects that are most important,1
simple and inexpensive,1
much wider than you probably think,1
undercooked but greasy,1
open until 4 am,1
a little expensive for me,1
waaaay too much,1
chewy and flavorless despite being labelled as cajun,1
still crisp,1
tasty and very,1
a little tighter,1
 2 hush,1
well worth the 800 for the burrito and hush,1
so delicious and worth,1
fairly reasonable for the portion quality and taste,1
hot and deathly spicy,1
more to wacky wings than wings,1
else but that,1
very family friendly which might turn some of you off but if you do have,1
lovely especially,1
fresh local,1
slightly lesser,1
extremely painful because she was using her nails and a nail file to separate the cured gel from my skin then filed away at my skin in an effort to shape the nails,1
thick uneven,1
really sloppy,1
very nice and very polite,1
really clean and super cute,1
open late on the weekend,1
worth the drive to the ne,1
pleased to see the door menu advertised vegan options,1
quite small cramped,1
worth more than mine,1
wise we do not get a chance to spend any money,1
whipped or roasted,1
upscale relaxed,1
expensive but stiff,1
ready to leave when the waitress said oh we have this menu too,1
minimal at best,1
very glad i did,1
mushy and flavorless,1
too awkward to watch after a while so i just kind of stared at the wall which had interesting details until my food was ready,1
very lovely,1
expensive to have authentic cheese curds in your poutine in calgary,1
really soft,1
happy for one reason,1
worth spending more than 30 minutes,1
decent and you can get some really good infused vodka and if you are lucky a seat,1
a bit excited,1
glad they did,1
really happy with the quality and the prices and the results,1
pleased with waffle house,1
pretty busy on a saturday morning,1
pleased he could get chocolate chips over the waffle,1
small yet intemate,1
a little disappointed in that sense,1
much larger than the other locations,1
close to a show,1
pleasantly surprised at the quality of this hotel,1
a little annoyed i had to pay for wifi,1
too far from the epicenter,1
beautiful but in the dead of winter with my flight canceled,1
too happy about being in north carolina,1
sure i was not stuck in some seedy motel,1
overly luxurious,1
decent considering there,1
very helpful and sympathetic,1
too big considering i was all by my lonesome,1
soft and comfortable,1
pretty old,1
cold and late,1
excellent but pricey,1
disappointed in the car wash,1
shocked to then,1
clean than a rain storm,1
worth it save your money,1
way too high for the lack of food quality,1
so tiny,1
less than my local dealership to do it,1
last at least 3 4,1
spotless small and simple,1
very affordable for everything,1
spicy dark and super,1
very different for us,1
separate from the rice but full of pineapple flavor,1
special to avoid confusion after a brief argument she gave me the special price,1

cool enough to not say anything,1
simple but wonderful,1
both very pleased,1
so endearing to see,1
clean and efficient,1
right around the corner from me,1
here so much,1
same shy,1
favorite with the shredded beef,1
classically simple,1
open till 11 pm,1
very defined,1
by there more,1
better than i would have expected,1
better than the local fast food in the same price range,1
pleasant to think of returning to,1
insane selection of beer and reasonably priced,1
so painful,1
filthy see,1
a little expensive for breakfast compare to their competition like ihop and denny s,1
great not as crunchy,1
hard to find a large yummy pickle anywhere in the city,1
overcooked dry,1
nothing more than steak ums,1
lousy tasting overall,1
noisy crowded and terrible to find parking,1
a spot free,1
not necessary open till 6 pm,1
so huge in there,1
so convinced we even asked the waitress if they were owned by wild wings,1
pretty true,1
not sure if it was butter or what from putting it on the griddle,1
more aware of their surroundings people coming going,1
already large,1
small but overpriced,1
ready at 10 in the morning i stressed that i needed it back by 10,1
very impressed with the food and especially the people who worked there,1
very accommodating very upscale,1
impressed with the pricing,1
delicious creative and well executed,1
gooey and hearty,1
less impressive,1
great for a family or for someone travelling on business,1

convenient to the interstates and airport,1
convenient to both,1
free so,1
able to check in,1
higher priced,1
almost ok,1
busy for a noght with a mayweather boxing match happening,1
needless to say no tip was given for poor service,1
sure none of my friends come here either,1
so darn,1
cheesy glorious ness,1
delicious with caramelized onions and bleu cheese on a 12 lb quality patty of beef,1
even more generous,1
so good on a fall or winter day,1
spacious clean and nicely decorated,1
very unsatisfactory,1
busy during sporting events and holidays,1
highly disorganized,1
much better under previous ownership,1
spicy about it,1
too bad because i really liked this place,1
low key,1
super fast and very reasonably priced,1
shocked to find out they had doubled their price within a month,1
that right,1
top notch and super fast,1
excited to try this one out,1
totally just flat out ignoring the people next to us,1
too packed,1
something unique to here,1
great they tasted like regular fries that were colored orange,1
cheesy at all,1
special but still good,1
juicy and very tasty,1
sure to try the veal meatballs the eggplant parmigiana and the almighty lasagna,1
casual romantic,1
much better places to stay in charlotte do not waste your time or money,1
pleasantly surprised at the large menu chico s offered,1
hard to get alcohol since there were not many people there,1
just glad it was not crowded,1
nice thick,1
pleased with my services and most everything,1
tastefully decorated and extremely clean,1
small but pretty awesome,1
more fresh and tasty,1
fully manned and ready,1
pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food,1
a little sketchy with not a lot of parking,1
walled off from the suckers,1
similar to the insane vegas pricing for alcohol especially inside a major strip casino,1
there even better tasting,1
ready after another customer s drink,1
very annoying and disappointing,1
very sloppy,1
rude before,1
sure from now,1
really gassy,1
very personable and friendly,1

dry and crumbly,1
so long to get wings that we gave up after 12,1

curious to why he was doing that,1
stunned yet permanently disabled,1
free for soda,1
a bit annoying by saying,1
just about perfect,1
pretty small with no dance floor but good,1
similar in style,1
very nice to sit in despite how cold it was outside,1
so tired and gross,1
ready so i waited in the center space,1
so loud and obnoxious it sounded like they were preparing for a dance party,1
so tired and gross i did not want to sit on it,1
one disappointed,1
excited to see that they had 8 beer flights,1
a little more interactive,1
wrong with some cajun mexican fusion,1
around 30 45,1
cold too,1
really disorganized,1
really good i am going to,1
cold on the inside,1
sure who she is,1
so cold,1
generally minimal,1
quick talking,1
clean and well stocked,1
but not quite warm and delicious,1
cute much,1
nicer than your usual chain reflete with wooden parrots and brightly colored,1
newly found,1
hungry while walking by a banh mi boys location again,1
about 169 more,1
sure you eat at another place and do not make this your last poutine,1
real spicy,1
almost impossible to eat a small due to the texture one dimensional flavor,1
cheap mexican food,1
heavy and greasy,1
sure to have no plans after eating so that you may lounge around feeling large,1
pretty good sized,1
okay service i,1
extremely great,1
just jealous,1
so nice to,1
the nicer we got the mooore rude she became,1
sorry for that restaurant,1
genuinely like it,1
nice with that 15 dollars,1
less tasty than average chinese food,1
right as we were escorted to our table,1
good but obviously not healthy,1
lit up,1
particularly small,1
consistently amazing,1
enough of their squid,1
much better in terms of service,1
great for parties a game day feast,1
alone on your couch,1
perfectly soft,1
quick and pleasant,1
quick easy delicious and reasonably priced to tote,1
overcrowded with seniors during week for lunch,1
so noisy,1
amazingly attentive,1
steve young enough,1

very odd within the rooms,1
responsible for,1
able to accommodate us,1
brand better,1
nice to give us more,1
expensive and mildly gross,1
just how much,1
free to take this review with a grain of salt,1
often crowded,1
tired sad and mildly ill,1
good and many,1
too amazed by banh mi boys,1
unlucky to have been here during march madness,1
too slow in getting there,1
good enough to get my attention,1
lettuce 2 good sized,1
sure to share with them today,1
even interested in dinner,1
very low for the quality and quantity of food received,1
wrong about that,1
delicious food,1
really americanized,1
almost gristly,1
amazing or incredible,1
hard to make,1
too hard to master,1
half baked,1
accessible and acceptable,1
too large for a taco,1
accustomed to when traveling in az,1
slow to come out,1
so intense i usually want a nap afterwards,1
chill and overall,1
loud and a little chaotic on saturday mornings,1
special or creative,1
very tasty and buttery,1
good yet too small,1
willing to dish out more money and order more than one item to make sure you do not walk out hungry,1
more friendly to the lanky pale man who she handed 2 beers to at 10 am in the morning,1
family owned and nonfranchise,1
interested in at chico s,1
quite popular and worth the 100 each as they are were large authentic deli style sour pickles however during my recent visit i purchased 5 pickles at 100 each and as the pickles were being pulled out of the large glass jar behind the counter i noticed that the pickles looked quite small,1
smaller than normal,1
interesting to note that this was also posted on their facebook page and was deleted,1
happy to say that i stopped by on the way back from a softball game in north park for a beer and discovered the roasted zucchini hummus flatbread,1
great except the price,1
desperate in finding a good italian place to eat without breaking my bank,1
super happy to discover 7 and mama rosa,1
delicious 2,1
value good,1
friendly from the front desk to the bar and just anyone you see that works at the hotel they were never rude always polite,1
out of place,1
sure if you leave your room double check if the door is throughly locked,1
new to vegas,1
almost flavorless,1
good as was the rice,1
sure our stay and event was awesome,1
more well known,1
fresh unique delicious,1
very korean,1
impossible for the people in amatrice,1
relatively affordable,1
cheaper or more,1
hard pressed to get anything besides the cat fish po boy,1
super consistent which is great and great value for the flavour it packs,1
difficult to get seats,1
not so big,1
a lot nicer than the outside so fret not if you think the exterior is chintzy,1
good with my veal meatball appetizer which was easily the best dish of the night,1
juicy perfectly flavoured and just delicious,1
good but very salty,1
stragenly hard,1
kind of unfair,1
nice fluffy,1

when fresh,1
lrb delicious rrb and fruit lrb good rrb,1
amazed to see how much food people pile onto one plate,1

great not the cheapest,1
most extensive and impressive,1
full with her baby girl,1
sure you call ahead if it is game day because they will get slammed,1
fair for the tuesday price lrb would not ever recommend them at the 3 they normally are rrb dry and a bit bland no pico,1
mex cajun,1
accustomed to having,1

entirely confident,1
difficult and tricky,1
divey out of the way,1
freshly prepared delicious,1
huge lrb we ordered lo mein vegetable fried rice and salt and pepper shrimp rrb and very reasonably priced,1
both salty and spicy,1
so happy to have found a terrific chinese food restaurant,1
more than generous in portion sizes,1
amazing along with the lobster macaroni and cheese,1
absolutely tasting,1
amazed by the staff and the delicious food that is prepared,1
specific for the season the most recent visit we enjoyed a plethora of items from the menu,1
amazingly fresh,1

far too long,1
10 15 more,1
clean on the outside,1

more refined than denny s,1
more upscale and prim,1
tree lined,1
 casual but casual,1
running and good,1
outstanding customer service,1
willing to give md nail spa another chance to have a better experience,1
better than chipotle,1
wrong bite after bite,1
better than i,1
awesome free,1
close the food is good,1
other than that the front desk to the room were very good,1
sure what odor they were trying to cover up,1
hot toppings are awesome,1
barely hot,1
hesitant to go,1
crustacean centered,1
similar to getting your toes wet at the beach for the first time in years with warm and calm water and seeing a shooting star take a six second stroll across the sky,1
enough to raise an eyebrow and the creamy filling seals the deal like car salesman on cocaine,1
absurdly amazing,1
great to have a place to satisfy the late night munchies,1
just lucky,1
amazing for any sporting event,1
smaller in size to most wings,1
bland and uninteresting,1
so familiar,1
ever possible,1
all you can eat wing night,1
right for 15 you could have all you can eat wings of one flavour all night,1
overly vinegar y,1
short on the to mississauga,1
nice and dim,1
very generous with the rice,1
a proud canadian,1
about to get cheesy,1
free on chocolate,1
one am glad,1
extremely polite and professional,1
absolutely scrumptious to the last bite,1
extremely inebriated,1
so pissed,1
fetal like,1
terribly understaffed,1
filthy by the end of service,1
convertible detailed,1
buffed as agreed upon and paid for,1
pretentious or clubby,1
damn tasty can not say i have had anything like it,1
amazing friendly and personable,1
out of town we spent a lot of time searching for the best poutine in calgary and were largely disappointed,1
better than the worst,1
almost mute,1
there far better,1
full in a few bites,1
very hospitable and professional,1
very impressed can not wait to come back,1
inconvenient to get directly to work,1
easy to get in and out of when i am headed west on mcdowell,1
even flavorful,1
clean and fast and completely serviceable,1
water and comfortable,1
unbelievably packed,1
difficult to pass guests employees if you must pass them by,1
able to take half of the sandwich home to have at a later date,1
decent food,1
a meal in themselves and super delicious,1
straight nasty if you can avoid,1
cold old and gross,1
amazing for all you carb lovers,1
fun to watch the cook behind the counter,1
great to see people take pride in their work,1

delicious and much better,1
pretty good but a little greasy,1
super nice and able to get me in right away,1
clean new and super pretty on the inside,1
very meticulous to make sure they were perfect and to my liking,1
beautiful i might be back later this week,1
really disappointed in my visit,1
excited to check out the dt location after the game,1
due to the service,1
hard to share your discovery with the world,1
cleanliness service and spa like,1
best clean and reasonably priced,1
comparable to those that are offered in local hotel spas but less,1
pampered and relaxed,1
how shiny and perfect,1
unmatched for the service you get,1
waaay too much for a mediocre service,1
so clean and relaxing,1
insanely tender,1
so glad they opened up near work,1
great for a quick and cheap lunch,1
quick attentive and friendly,1
sad to say they,1
next to my work,1
reasonably priced for the amount of food you get,1
a little weird with the seat yourself setting,1
delicious can not wait to try it,1
as good as the hushpuppies were,1
terrible from the minute,1
good to eat,1
adventurous enough to try their more adventurous creations like mucho italiano or the notorious pig lrb rip piggie smalls rrb,1
slightly overwhelming,1
more worried about talking to everyone than getting patrons taken care had the worst bar tender in a long time,1
more worried about talking to everyone than getting patrons taken care of,1
however many,1
nice to have been given the entire picture on the phone,1
practically dead,1
impossibly thin,1
way too spicy,1
way too tiny for the price,1
better than the sashimi experience,1
a cone of parsley tossed,1
barely half full,1
incredible hard,1
too sweet to drink the full can at times,1
brave enough to step out in the hallway in my pjs with my bags packed to go and get a room key,1
much nicer on every levels,1
sorry that this happened to you,1
right in the middle of downtown phoenix,1
similar to their other bars,1
very hip and modern,1
alright poutine,1
pre game,1
wrong in the right direction,1
fairly priced for being right next to the stadiums,1
slightly distracting,1
at least acceptable,1
overwhelmingly spicy,1
loyal to hilton embassy suites,1
complete everything will be more put together,1
so modern,1
able to make it to the complimentary happy hour either day i was there,1
too far from downtown and southpark,1
just wrongg,1
many hot items to choose from and like many other buffets have several varieties of chicken shrimp that all taste the same,1
pretty bland and unimaginative,1
some of these like bacon wrapped,1
quite arbitrary,1
you blind,1
staff and charge extra,1
unwelcoming to basically have someone follow you around and watch you eat,1
so happy to discover that banh mi boys is veg friendly,1
tasty and inexpensive,1
even more extraordinarily affordable than it already is,1
very nice spacious,1
separate from bath,1
really more of a take out place,1
very clean and quiet,1
delicious and tasty,1
even remotely close to being wiped down,1
way too big and full of stringy gristle,1
nice and other,1
able to get the light,1
even slightly improved,1
needless to say it was a minime version of something that wanted to be worth the 9 bucks i paid,1
right next me,1
so heinous,1
horrible left a bad taste in my mouth for 3 days,1
pretty upscale,1
free to sit at them until someone comes and gets bottle service,1
perfect for those in their 20s and 30s,1
pretty similar to most other chinese buffet s,1
spicy hot and sour,1
three bite,1
just acceptable,1
awesome just good enough,1
ready to wait,1
good to us,1
two 11 oz,1
much to begin with,1
worth 10,1
oddly built,1
good old fashioned witless,1
a sexist,1
ok for you,1
cold and blustery,1
homey and folksy,1
overly friendly,1
shockingly small,1
important to them,1
both utterly disgusting,1
a little better on the way up when body heat partially melted them,1
very cute and charming,1
as well very convenient and unexpected,1
clear across the room,1
nicely packed,1
certainly much more approachable,1
expensive lrb 90 for six drinks rrb and just okay lrb not very strong rrb,1
ready to go somwhere,1
busy at time,1
tired of watching the boys gamble,1
nice in there,1
over crowded or too loud,1
super close to this chinese joint,1
ready within 10 mins,1
flat thick,1
more of a chinese,1
not thai,1
closed from the outside,1
bigger and more,1
polite and great,1
sure to give us ample warning for last call,1
the 4th after all so understandable,1
a little dry and small,1
a notch higher,1
able to be seated on time,1
pleased with the service and the food,1
helpful in answering our questions,1
not very familiar with charlotte,1
enough to raise your blood pressure,1
other than the onsite steak house which is great,1
outdated and dark,1
extremely attentive and courteous,1
consistent to bring us some pretty damn tasty hoagies,1
food old,1
totally fine,1
worth going to i,1
obvious it needs to be cleaned,1
worth about 100,1
uncalled for to have that taken from me,1
nice friendly,1
clean cozy,1
impressive with an open atrium that runs all the way up and looks down into a central area,1
tasty with lots,1
totally separate,1
very accommodating responsive and attentive,1
enough about the fine staff decor and rooms,1
convenient to downtown and the airport,1
all free,1
too often cliched,1
even different,1
all very happy,1
very friendly helpful and generally awesome,1
very friendly and super nice,1
slightly awkward,1
pleased with our stay,1
lucky us,1
pretty dark and chill we only stayed there long enough to finish our bottle of vodka and leave to the bank so we could get the party started,1
midwest raised,1
cajun spicy,1
the hotter,1
a little hot for her,1
willing to endure,1
red hot,1
perfect and reasonably priced for two,1
even greater,1
hot so i am guessing mild,1
really mild,1
very very casual,1
made upon request,1
excited to try authentic italian food,1
how tight,1
pretty cheap for the pasti,1
dissapointed because there was so much,1
soft crispy,1
 very dim,1
so incredibly poor,1
fairly quiet,1
perfectly fine with us,1
more than enough to share lrb 3 rrb,1
much better and extremelyyyy fresh,1
funny and perfectly fine we both settled for beers,1
so bobby had to run down the street and withdraw money while i waited for the food,1
more than enough to take home for another meal,1
asleep on my bed,1
very impressed with him,1
sure it shortened my life,1
not very impressed,1
attentive knowledgeable and just overall cool,1
very consistent with their taste and quality,1
very orangey,1
ready to be tossed in a bowl of fresh cavatelli pasta,1
typical pasta pizzeria,1
helpful in explaining the theme of the restaurant,1
needless to say they,1
simple yet magnificent,1
sort of stew like tomato based,1
less of exceptional,1
better warmed up,1
so welcoming and friendly that we had to take pictures with her,1
lucky if you can even find a server,1
server but good,1
cold but sunny,1
sure this area will be packed,1
1 sour,1
very experienced,1
thinner and crispy with a hint of the flavouring,1
tooooo saucy,1
so excited for the second location,1
modern sophisticated and very beautiful such,1
hard to find a home for my spa and nail needs,1
less than outstanding,1
apparently experienced,1
gun shy,1
both drier than the surrounding desert,1
colossally dumb,1
domestic and japanese,1
much more than a time share masquerading as a casino,1
culinary cognitive,1
completely unexpected,1
unbelievably untapped,1
knowledgeable of his wine,1
glad to be greeted with amicable and friendly service,1
entirely limited,1
willing to make accomodations,1
good enough for seconds lrb which were promptly devoured rrb,1
rough on my hands and nails,1
so small it did not bother me that much,1
severely irritating,1
dirty dusty and not well maintained,1
obvious all cleaning was on the surface level,1
wrong with the one you got,1
very unsavory,1
customer friendly,1
a bit overpriced,1
much earlier than before,1
friendly and efficient enough,1
worth a shot,1
beer awesome,1
happy people are dining in your place of business,1
very unfriendly and unwelcoming,1
cheap cheap,1
authentically enjoyable,1
already crowded,1
fast but not that friendly,1
decent price and chilled,1
dark and crowded,1
fresh and clean,1
happy to not work,1
pretty busy at times,1
eindruck aber ok,1
better could be worse its good for groups but nothing more,1
awesome super,1
hotter if it was on regular bone in wings,1
curious about this devil s inferno,1
nice and cold,1
really friendly and knowledgeable,1
pretty hesitant,1
amazing with bold and tasty flavours,1
bored of it,1
pretty worth,1
great for parties and tailgates,1
sure some people would say i am biased,1
completely fine with,1
so happy i discovered this nail salon,1
able to get both done at the same time,1
cold and unappetizing,1
due to reading the good reviews,1
overly packed,1
more of a place,1
a bit too pricey,1
how extremely spacious,1
glad my efforts were not wasted when i planned to study there,1
awake for my evening class,1
sweet as other chai,1
very nice and helpful in replying to all off the questions,1
very thoughtful,1
not very busy so not sure what the problem is,1
fatty from the heavy marbling and an intense buttery flavor,1
clear from this place,1
relatively poor,1
pleasantly surprised with the big cheese,1
phenomenal for 7,1
insane insane hard,1
super juicy and slightly charred,1
friendly service and patience,1
lousy service and poutine,1
close to home for us,1
unfriendly or bad,1
fairly average,1

a cult like,1
vertical not flat down,1
oldest and dearest,1
hot delicious fresh,1
careful next time someone may find a finger in their drink,1
nice courteous and patient,1
even big,1
very good and tasty,1
very typical for what you expect from a chinese buffet,1
wrong at this place,1
so flavorful and crispy,1
 11 total,1
simple but organic and locally sourced,1
delicious fresh squeezed,1
willing to look past it,1
as cute,1
really really hot,1
hard to adjust to the perfect point in spring,1
very clean and roomy too again great for families,1
amazed by the service both trish and jimmy made me very comfortable and relaxed,1
overcooked and flavorless,1
illegal to sell food this bad,1
allergic to it,1
visible there was mold,1
as bad as the first,1
obvious they do not,1
good i guess,1
a seedy looking,1
able to transform my big block looking acrylic nails into this fabulous masterpiece,1
super cool and big copper sign out front is awesome,1
fast and fri,1
long and thorough and relaxing,1

meticulous and attentive,1
awkward plain,1
unfaithful to you,1

egg special,1
careful in some states it comes with nasty ass grits,1
even uglier,1
super large and meaty,1
special a bit,1
tasty full of flavour well sauced,1
really a,1
super crispy without being over cooked,1
fun and festive like a big tiki festival,1
amazed at what i tasted,1
excited to try something else on their menu,1
more bizarre than anything else,1
less than clean,1
a little deceptive because upholstery and leather treatment sounds like the seats,1
helpful to customers,1
ready so quickly after ordering,1
super happy with my experience,1
just not worth the hype,1
funny you say any preexisting conditions on our vehicle would have caused this,1
just negative,1
perfectly running,1
great valued,1
simplistic taste but perfect for a light,1
pretty damn perfect,1
excited to come back and try some more,1
very personable and attentive,1
pretty stellar,1
enough to enjoy but nothing that is going to harm,1
surprised at how terrible the service was,1
not unmanageable,1
very disappointed and surprised,1
regular or thin,1
well supplied,1
looking and undercooked,1
allergic to crab,1
rich enough i think i could only justify eating it at the end of a big athletic trip,1
crowded and a tiny bit loud,1
too downtown hipster,1
fantastic throughout the entire meal,1
happy and hungry,1
available in the bar and the personal dining area,1
not a bad,1
understandable that there will be,1
so clean and fancy,1
completely indifferent and dismissive,1
fortunate enough to encounter my newest addiction at the phoenix food truck festival,1
delightfully fluffy moist,1
fairly convinced jamburrito can do no wrong,1
two queen sized,1
ready when promised and there are so many locations that you are always close to one,1
very nicely spaced,1
familiar with the travelzoo offer,1
extremely attentive without being intrusive,1
spectacular to say the least,1
fresh and fantastic,1
most unique and flavorful,1
seriously overrated,1
happy to get one for us,1
dirty less friendly and most,1
all closed,1
unique and intimate with a limit of about twenty people per class,1
simple and minimalistic,1

golden with rosemary,1
loud or busy,1
very chill on sunday,1
always fast fresh and delicious,1
really impressed with banh mi boys,1

a bit concerned about is the cleanliness,1
too close to this restaurant,1
sorry you did not when you are down to your last bite,1
pre order,1
particularly rude,1
so excited there is a downtown location now,1
great with board games and styling,1
enough for review,1
very few bike parking options and only street parking so they should look at installing a bike rack lrb maybe not possible,1
good for working on my computer,1
more around the 2 250 mark,1
quite ridiculous,1
dry from sitting in a warming pot,1
better to try outside of an event like this,1
so promising,1
hot as in temperature hot,1
least satisfying,1
very hungry after a long day,1
as good as the ones i had two days ago at umami burger,1
good no more,1
much you can eat at ruth s chris morton s and probably 174 independent steakhouses in the us and have killer,1
shut to not because a scene,1
tacky with the lit up palm tree and pseudo hunter furnishing,1
pretty impressed with the personal tv in the dining booths,1
perfect for the big game,1
how many of the same saucy,1
medium or spicy,1
long over due,1
hard to choose what to get,1

richer or higher on the social scale,1
horrid urinal was about to fall off the wall,1

pretty empty during those,1
all spotty,1
very very poor,1

so popular it is rare that it is not packed,1
even better you get real steak fresh veggies and most importantly soft,1
warm and family little cozy,1
menu and service amazing,1
vibe excellent,1
pretty clean for the most part,1
busy because they do not replace the food at all on the weekdays when its not busy,1
very friendly and efficient,1

absolutely unbelievable,1
sure there was not any damage to my car,1
so disgusted i did not even let the hobo that went from table to table begging for money,1
other than the flat screen,1
awe inspiring,1
disappointing and irritating,1
long as my previous experiences,1
busy nor hectic,1
near spectacular or exciting,1
sour and spicy,1
way too understaffed,1
at least satisfied with what you paid for,1
better of driving to spring mountain and actually getting a decent meal,1
super hard,1
first first friday,1
very glad to have been introduced to this hip comfortable modern bar,1
much more cramped intimate,1
spacious with appropriate lighting and plenty of seating,1
all dark and seemingly sophisticated and lounge like,1
a bit deceptive,1
a bit overdone,1
uber salty,1
old fashioned or environmentally conscious,1
horrible do not waste your money,1
new but very nice,1
downright cheap,1
locally raised,1
all day happy,1
far too loud,1
great with some minor flaws,1
all around poor,1

nicely balanced,1
excellent on,1
better until now the truffle macaroni and cheese really impressed me,1
bigger than the bethany home location,1
so happy with my dish,1
flaky and full,1
greasy yet yummy,1
so sad but done,1
not hard to deep fry potatoes and order curds in from quebec,1
so so bland,1
sure to be overwhelmed lrb in a good way rrb,1
minuscule but delicious and very adult,1
so cool and happy to help you pick the perfect drink,1
extra pissed at this bc it would have never happened back home in chicago,1
wayyyy overpriced,1
better off getting tipsy at the bar right outside the entrance then walking in to chill and listen to music,1
attentive and timely,1
excellent as was the steak ordered by the fourth in our party,1
substantial in the halibut dish,1
wonderful as was the creme brulee with berries,1
very very cheery,1
hesitant to give them another shot,1
full until dinner,1
a little too messy,1
comparable to other waffle house restaurants,1
the most welcoming,1
sad to see that there was seemingly only one employee working both the counter and dining area,1
sort of busy,1
ideal for those looking to have a fun yet,1
happy hour from 1 8,1
small cramped,1
double fisted,1
hungry for wings,1

extremely tender and very tasty,1
okay with very simple ingredients peas and lamb,1
clean and quite,1
cold with cheese crackers and mini corn dogs,1
excited to try out the edge steakhouse located inside the westgate in which we were staying,1
uncomfortable during our dining experience,1
better than we expected especially the sushi,1

family oriented and kid friendly lrb in the back corner there is a play place rrb,1
excellent quick and friendly,1
more light and refreshing,1
fresh healthy and delicious,1
very colourful and cool,1
flame broiled,1
interested in trying the beef,1
modern and big with a nice sized bathroom and exceptionally clean,1
full of kind and helpful staff who always were polite courteous and friendly,1
great for a midday walk lots of lovely houses and woods,1
enough for a meal with a good portion of pulled pork in it,1
not afraid to pile it on,1
all nice and hot,1
so massive,1
fairly sure,1
large enough to satisfy me for three complete meals,1
awesome for 5,1
sure to try it with your free chips,1
glad that this little joint is downtown and not somewhere completely stupid,1
affordable authentic,1

never great,1
glad we finally have a decent cafe in the area,1
beautiful in here,1
good for lunch or dinner,1
lucky enough to have it made by one of the many tattooed men,1
greasy and heavy nothing artisan or fancy about it,1
better off stopping at a high school band car wash,1
simple in nature,1
hard to finish a large by myself which at 699 1000 is an excellent value,1
family kid friendly,1
super strong and tasty,1
so chewy,1
very fresh and crisp,1
hard to find since it is at 17th ave,1
much about the waffle,1
very convenient for me,1
disappointed and disgusted,1
sure a business could be run more poorly than this place,1
soo frustrated,1
poor or cheap,1
very happy to see when there are plenty of vegetarian options,1
tasty as hell,1
really good for the price,1
free for the first 2 hrs,1

relaxed but fun,1
willing to give recommendations,1
super clean professional and great,1
able to get two of us in right away for pedis,1

how cozy and plush,1
adjacent to the bar,1
amazing in accomadating us,1
overall and definitely,1
aware that a coffee purist would snub us for mixing coffee with chai,1
well lit and spacious,1
different and sometimes multiple,1
so adorably silly,1
very beautiful spacious and tidy,1
true to life find,1
fancy no gimmicks,1
more than enough for each of us,1
crispier the cheese could have been a tad more plentiful and squeaky,1
mixed with the veg,1
cute and as crowded,1
korean vietnamese,1
a little easier to munch on than the sandwiches if you have a smaller mouth,1
sure there are plenty of places that will take my money,1
perfect right by my husbands,1
fast and amazing,1
flavorful spicy fresh and wonderful,1
bland stale and cold,1
so close for nights,1
nice to try some of the many flavours,1

too keen on chinese food buffets,1
pre saint,1
much more stronger,1
loaded with,1
cool like that,1

the best out of all of them,1
good for bigger parties,1
very pleased that they opened this location at yonge and eglinton,1
so delicious with fun,1
very undercooked and cold,1
best to share with them,1
pricey for jazzed up fries with a little bit of gravy cheese and meat,1
wonderful about it,1
generally satisfied with the experience,1
belly delicious,1
very good with three sauces only tried red with lots of horseradish just the way i like it,1
cold but good with herb butter and roasted garlic only one clove,1

good at standing around to burritoboyz to find how hot is made,1
clean facility and friendly staff,1
i glad i took the drive,1
enough to share lrb with the soup rrb,1
surprised to see spring rolls in the order which i had not asked for,1
pretentious and rude,1
typical of any coffee shop mediocre,1
too sweet for me,1
layered with different items,1
reasonable but not particularly tasty,1
worthy for a visit,1
cute and comfy,1
tres tacos nothing else,1
sure it is like every other taco shop on mcdowell,1
fast and busy,1
super psyched,1
cheaper in the end,1
a bit disappointed that the habanero sauce was not spicy,1
so happy to know about this place,1
pretty huge for ayce,1
generally very busy and pretty noisy,1
very inconsiderate of our financial loss,1
similar to what it was before and does not try to go modern like the ayrsley location,1
less than pristine,1
good to curve drunks,1
sorry to say that it was not all i would hoped for,1
bar traditional american,1
busy normal for 745 pm,1
very rustic,1
meat roasted,1
baked in tomato sauce,1

cozy but noisy,1
good and very expensive,1
a little hesitant about the price,1
great customer service and super fast,1
retro two,1
so nice and helpful as it was our first time,1
close to talking stick arena and the phoenix convention center,1
so trendy,1
great because they are open late and never rush you out,1
soggy and greasy,1
hard and fatty,1
rather large and open,1
unpretentious and knowledgeable,1
close to 40 taps i believe always rotating,1
really thin with her,1
needless to say the food,1
completely shtty,1
responsible for tables at the opposite end of the restaurant,1
friendly and family oriented,1
nice to have a table to sit at all tables were not bussed,1
off filled w crumbs or grease,1
complete with plaid an eerily similar menu and a black and white character plastered all over,1
only one thing different,1
hot enough to melt the cheese,1
willing to give them another try on a future trip to calgary,1
better for me,1
better and the cheese melted,1
easy to spend time with friends over drinks here and really enjoy yourself,1
very sexy,1
locally sourced naturally raised,1
micro roasted,1
sourced via direct or fair trade,1
infinitely patient on this first busy day,1
super excited to try this location out as well,1
remarkably cheery and amiable,1
30 mins late,1
open at 6 am,1
awfully bad,1
pretty similar to what you would hear in a club anyway so come here get a few drinks and groove,1
full with sushi orange chicken general tso s chicken bourbon chicken and a shrimp mixture,1
remotely low,1
very heavy of lard or whatever they use to cook everything in,1
slightly ill from sitting in my tummy,1
all star special with a pecan,1
common at these joints,1
most chinese,1
very very generous,1
pretty darn tasty,1
first or second,1
more than willing to try them again due to the lovely pastries and the smiles,1
hard to walk and then see they gave me,1
alright for the price you pay,1
quite surprised to find my car still had not come through and there were no cars or people there,1
right off the bat,1
quite irritated and upset,1
baffling and perplexing,1
good for lunch delivery,1
almost offensive to eat,1
okay but not exceptional,1
a little pricey for food that was average lrb i am being kind rrb tasting and barely warm,1
amazed by how much i got,1
so welcoming and nice,1
high in sugar,1
good as any,1
fantastic pretty much melted in my mouth,1
excellent very welcoming and generally great,1
as great as when i have previously had their food,1

unable to give us a time for the shuttle,1
absolutely refreshing,1
able to enjoy it anywhere else,1
clean and neat lrb mostly rrb,1
 good morning or welcome,1

hot and the cheese curds somewhat melted,1
too salty as a whole,1
busy at 1030 pm on a saturday,1
really patient and polite,1
sleek and sexy,1
dark and well decorated,1
very disappointed with little dumpling overall,1
surprised to see how reasonable to prices were great lunch specials,1
so excited to try this place,1
quick calm,1
separate from the pedicures,1
quicker than pedicures,1
worth all the relaxation and customer care,1
quite impressed with the layout of the restaurant,1
somewhat dissatisfying,1
most meaty,1
mediocre so i would not get them again,1
really nice and fast,1
able to do late check out with no hassle lrb ended up not needing it rrb,1
very dismissive,1
awesome with her customer service skills,1
odd to find a place so cute and well stocked at lazy daisy,1
available at lunch,1
straight out,1
crazy friendly,1
sure i would want to head here into the evening because while the art on the wall by local artisans lend to the urban hip feel the cash for gold type places across the street do not have the same je ne cest quoi,1
better than a cup of java after a long day of helping clients in the area,1
overly helpful but not downright rude,1
pretty good as were the beans and rice lrb with salsa from their salsa bar of course rrb,1
average and a little overpriced but decent,1
nice because its private,1
bad letting my son eat that garbage for dinner,1
again gross,1
old all packed up,1
ready for a wait,1
interesting and wide,1
cheerful and pleasant,1
worse than a burrito,1
hush puppies and cajun tartar,1
happy to hear they have motown jamming in the background too,1
a bit sketchy,1
orange and green tiled,1
even better than i remember fantastic fresh bread,1
better than danny s,1
hush puppies and a chicken,1
k taco plate,1
hush puppy,1
soft oozy,1
sick after eating here,1
clear of the clams,1
thai and chinese,1
outstanding so much so that even today our crew is still talking about how great our server jaymee was,1
too large for them,1
really lousy,1
worth about 500,1
too terrible,1
satisfied with,1
lucky enough to be able to go when grandma is cooking it really,1
very very reasonable for toronto,1
seriously ginormous,1
delish too,1
too salty that tasted bitter,1
small and quite dark,1
difficult to see your food properly,1
able to see it if it is cooked properly or if the kitchen crew may have personally customized your food without your knowledge,1
good for two people,1
not even warm through,1
too strong in sweetness,1
inexpensive delicious and right,1
fresh with a light crispy crust,1
sour and sweet,1
big and full,1
exactly professional or appetizing,1
really busy in there,1
friendly and lively,1
so big i could only finish half of it for lunch,1
neat for them,1
good with friendly service,1
too cramped,1
the shrimp based,1
too close for comfort,1
conducive to the customer enjoying their meal,1
small intimate,1
good music,1
slightly crisp,1
golden brown and flavorful,1
decent though bland,1
nice big pieces but again kind of bland,1
super big for one person,1
close to major freeway,1
tasty breakfast lrb free rrb,1
full on omelet,1
tired of the club,1
well enough to keep you coming back for more,1
rather loud,1
very very lovely,1
most italian,1
smaller because they are designed to be eaten through,1
quite salty to me which means sweetheart found them perfect,1
garlicky and olive oily,1
magically not acidic,1
very very hearty and rich,1
rich and almost heavy the pastas are,1
squeamish about seeing a puddle of oil at the bottom of their plate this,1
good but not as impressive,1
very herbal,1
kind of small though and quite salty but good,1
delightfully thick and succulent as juicy,1
too full to have it right away,1
dense and chocolatey and sweet without being too sweet,1
quite pleasant and patient,1
so many spots left uncleaned the drying aspect was not complete either as i could clearly see all the water spots and dirt still on my car,1
too bleh,1
craving quick,1
surprised only one person mentioned the achiote chicken salad,1
close and convenient,1
super garlic y,1
really greasy,1
bright yellow,1
too appealing,1
very satisfied for what it is,1
not nickle,1
excited to explore the new wp opening downtown,1
music awesome,1
waaaaayyyy too long,1
good fun,1
well mixed and lively,1
favorite if i am lucky,1
through yet never mushy,1
good its the shrimp,1
a little uncomfortable as he asked me where is the rest of the gang i said i was alone to which he replied in his new yawk accent i got your back and introduced himself,1
very handsome,1
delicious 7,1
petit filet with a side of mushrooms both delicious,1
good to take a date or go single,1
way more delicious,1
little to oily for my taste but super convenient location,1
ok for a i do not want to cook,1
underwhelming after the excellent lasagne,1
better served warm too,1
cozy warm,1
quick and prompt,1
so involved in his investment,1
too lean,1
much better in the summer,1
crazy fast,1
too damn dark in there,1
good enough to get to everyone on time,1
the money with a tip larger than i wanted to give him,1
easy to get into,1
more busy,1
free to get into,1
typical of any club music you heard,1
extremely fun and outgoing,1
very nice very comfortable,1
very dimly lit with dark corners for dark deeds poshly decorated,1
happy with the fast forward button,1
hard to pass by without noticing the mouth watering aroma and the big plaid awning flaring off the building,1
perfect for the two of us,1
best to go with one that was heavy and the other,1
slightly heavier,1
great to see a new fast food restaurant that is unique and non franchised,1
nice to have some variety and competition,1
open after they were done,1
occasionally long,1
beer battered,1
hot and fairly neat,1
good however a little small,1
still good not great but good,1
super clean and modern,1
extra hard to be sure i was happy,1
seemingly every,1
a bit more than you would expect to spend at a place like this,1
fun to see the whole thing,1
funny to see them picking up all the nuances of the waffle house,1
thi yellow or red,1
so hubby,1
not very friendly,1
more inclined to go when there is a game on all the tvs and for drinks not food,1
popular 7 numbers,1
afraid to have an extra glass of wine eat your entire basket of bread or order more than one pasta,1
unrivaled by any,1
almost philanthropic in a way,1
true to your italian roots,1
sure so will our other 100 guests,1
small and not cooked very well the chicken was too slimy no crispness,1
quite dark in here to where you almost can not see the menu,1
nice to find a place to sit and relax and have a drink in vegas,1
complete with some awkward quilted round,1
skinny hard,1
really difficult for this missouri girl,1
ridiculous for the quality of food,1
basic and familiar,1
very easy to make as long as you call two weeks in advance,1
able to book tables when bringing groups to watch sports events,1
close to this location,1
most likely the owner s 5 6 year,1
rapidly annoying,1
even possible,1
maybe 34 full,1
really less for a family of 3,1
really nice and talkative,1
similar to the sweet escape from wild wings,1
hot off the grill,1
very wet and not at all clean,1
thin cold and rubbery,1
extremely busy at lunch time,1
overwhelming like some places are,1
a little disappointed not to be going home that night,1
at least happy they put us up in a nice hotel,1
en route,1
full for the night,1
clear of their terrible service,1
american mexican and white,1
both hungry,1
reasonably priced and usually good,1
friendly and sincere,1
laden with the mains plus sides,1
hard pressed to finish all the food on account of being so full up,1
so seemingly simple they still manage to be unique and tasty in their own way,1
tender and enough,1
wonderfully layered enriched in a delicious tomato sauce,1
melt in the mouth,1
too salty to enjoy,1
surprisingly big container similar,1
well made and worth,1
little rough around,1
wholesome good value,1
perfect for a cosy night,1
fast simple and delicious,1
pretty boring,1
quick and very friendly,1
so dedicated to my job,1
basically amazing,1
extremely succulent,1
hard to beat jamburritos so try them out,1
very crowded for a saturday night,1
uber expensive,1
pretty buss,1
sure why we did not sit down,1
pretty chill cool,1
great honest,1
light crisp and the best,1
able to find decent food,1
lukewarm sweet and sour,1
especially indecisive,1
special one,1
unlucky to get food poisoning from eating their buns mind you,1
lacking and slow,1
simple and authentic,1
intimate but casual,1
on busy,1
noisy and a little crowded,1
very reasonable for the quality of ingredients,1
all super tasty,1
only annoying,1
a little short in the evening,1
cold greasy and thin,1
flavorless and paper thin,1
a truly relaxing and beautiful,1
similar to el pollo loco or something,1
presently surprised,1
very classic,1
out less,1
so amazing she take her time and do your nails with perfection i am so happy with her service,1
safe with a car wash,1
smeary streaky,1
so happy to see this business pop up in a neighborhood that has been a bit slow to gentrify,1
true that their pricing may be slightly higher than other businesses in the area,1
very pleasing clean and presentable,1
very important for me,1
better than everything else,1
favorite since growing up as a child,1
fat and fluffy,1
lean and crispy,1
affordable for young families,1
decently busy,1
lucky to get a table since the place is not too big,1
really good for sharing,1
very attentive and knowledgeable,1
primary demographic,1
not boneless,1
particularly hard and long,1
friendly and extremely courteous,1
tasty and fast,1
ready as planned,1
fun for the whole family,1
quick and amazing,1
ok good,1
hotter than the wings,1
pretty sure he is the only guy there,1
really good to go,1
needless to say it was worth the wait,1
often hit miss,1
fun to explore,1
needless to say that we had an amazing dining experience,1
chef steve young,1
nice to stop by and ask us,1
interested in trying the wagyu beef or the braised short ribs,1
little indian,1
more than enough for two people and a quick inexpensive meal,1
really very good,1
pleased to be the only patrons in the establishment at 4 pm on a thursday,1
happy with the cheap eats and friendly service,1
fresh by rotating their offerings,1
quite impressed with what i encountered,1
spacious elongated,1
actually worth,1
sweet and meaty,1
a classic ceramic lion headed,1
nicely seasoned and buttery medium rare,1
dipped in buerre,1
ordered baked,1
complete without a memorable dessert,1
all friendly and helpful,1
full but unsatisfied,1
definitely decorative,1
cozy sociable and great,1
almost impossible to mess it,1
quite unappetizing,1
just not attractive nor appetizing at all,1
too thick not too watery,1
pretty slow on rolling out the wings after you,1
much better off,1
right with that attitude,1
very unimpressive,1
very italian with 4 courses,1
nice in appearance waiter taking drinks was very rude and was never attended to order food,1
too special about their poutine except the fact,1
a bit crispier for my tastes,1
that hungry,1
poutine head straight,1
so happy with our experience,1
perfectly prepared,1
exceptionally so,1
polite charming and attentive,1
intrusive or overbearing,1
especially kind and welcoming,1
great overall and appealing,1
bored with the chains set menus,1
evilly delicious,1
small and sparsely decorated,1
not spicy mild medium and hot,1
generally favorable,1
based on other baskets i have seen come out,1
very friendly and helpful will definitely will be coming back again,1
very cocky,1
incredible about this,1
able to accommodate 26 adults,1
pretty stuffed,1
tucked in,1
enough for us,1
totally and utterly delicious,1
sure you are hungry,1
at best mediocre and mostly inedible,1
not only tough as shoe leather but cold,1
 cold as in intentionally chilled beef,1
cold as in our warmer is broken and this kabob was lrb over rrb cooked four hours ago and has been sitting out since then,1
very low budget,1
fairly nicely decorated,1
orange chicken bacon wrapped,1
crisp on the outside juicy,1
amazingly warm and light and not as greasy,1
as good as it,1
small enough inside the buffet was great,1
seaweed salad awsome,1
slightly intended,1
good for being treated differently for the way,1
fragrant and delightful,1
overwhelming do not worry,1
trivial pursuit or hungry,1
very reasonably priced and quick to serve you,1
only 5 months old,1
fun watching this place grow and become successful,1
so glad i tried this place out for summerlicious,1
hesitant to give another westgate restaurant a try,1
fun interesting,1
flavorful and cooked,1
very similar to the uptown location but with a little more room which is great,1
open pretty late,1
very happy about it,1
user friendly,1
good with ranch flavour is the favourite,1
that good in terms of understanding our order,1
good to hang around on weekends,1
fresh with you,1
very hefty for 2,1
more than enough to split very generous,1
glad we stopped here,1
sure your bills are accurate,1
so good for sports,1
a disgrace to the service industry,1
nearly empty although to sit at any of the empty tables,1
disgusted with how we were treated,1
ready to spend a lot of money,1
glad they did not let us get the bottle service even though we were going to when we first arrived,1
a little worse,1
at best average,1
so sad the first owners moved away,1
too sour like rotten fried dumpling meat taste like mixed meat,1
great lrb real rrb,1
acceptable for a place that gets really busy,1
pretty good for a chain,1
char to it,1
generous for a chain,1
fairly fresh,1
order ready,1
much better than pizza hut or dominos,1
noticeably stale,1
rude unwilling,1
completely unprofessional,1
shocked he would be placed in a management role as he had absolutely no managerial skills at all,1
extremely disappointed in this location,1
really fond of catfish,1
a little less than friendly,1
tough and bland,1
weird sour,1
very sorry,1
a lot better than this,1
pretty expansive despite being a food truck,1
ready within about 3 minutes,1
too much awesome going on,1
crazy spicy as i would anticipated,1
even more enjoyable,1
sure to make room for those hush puppies,1
small especially for the truck repping nola food,1
soooooo amazing,1
generous with the catfish,1
very generous with their portions,1
not cheap out on the gravy,1
highly reasonable,1
friendly quite knowledgable on their poutine,1
chicken scottish,1
different with a vibe and energy that they don t get at home,1
based perfect,1
very loud in the restaurant,1
plentiful and well prepared,1
extraordinarily worn and uncomfortable,1
heavy and outdated,1
happy and friendly,1
very updated and modern,1
great and huge,1
all awesome,1
better than average,1
sure it is great for drunk people late at night,1
polite and helpful,1
just as easy,1
friendly and comfortable,1
occupied and small,1
surprised that i have not reviewed this place before as i have been here at least 8 times,1
able to play the video games and win prizes,1
ok but merely ok,1
homely and delicious,1
quick friendly and attentive,1
cool and interesting,1
great music selection good,1
sick from it,1
so harsh,1
glad you spoke up before you eat the wrong thing,1
fine to eat here as long as the request no msg is made,1
the cutest,1
happy satiated and desirous,1
mostly unfavourable,1
sure most of the poutinerie s clientele make their way there,1
great but not terrible,1
high b,1
good and spice heat just about perfect,1
really unprofessional about everything,1
a bit somewhat slow,1
very attentive and fast,1
more cajun,1
sure to stop by,1
actually frequent,1
due to the attitude of a couple of attendants,1
often angry,1
a bit antiquated,1
super cheap during happy hour and still very reasonable when not,1
good if you go when they first open or when they are ramping up for dinner,1
able to stop by and get some take out,1
so tasty with lots of meat and the sweetness of the italian dressing,1
so nice he gave us a fifty percent discount on our meal,1
nice and cozy,1
quite romantic,1
warm and campy,1
a gluten intolerant,1
absolutely cheery and helpful,1
fluffy small but good,1
even hot,1
ready go get it,1
stoned and hung over,1
not appetizing at all,1
open to the dining room,1
very good for the most part,1
fresh simple and delicious,1
gone but not lamented bistro burger by partitioning off most of it lrb soon to be an italian joint rrb and creating a very intimate relaxing,1
a little reminscent,1
a knife unnecessary,1
just fine for my 48 hour buffalo,1
perfectly tender,1
baked in i do not know,1
creamy and cheesy and delicious,1
too good to have been anything else,1
disappointing very thin and watery and not very flavorful,1
practically raw,1
very annoying after i said,1
similarly good,1
attentive to every detail,1
too crispy,1
freshly picked before coming to the table,1
big and nice,1
basically tough,1
crazy and the manager said they do not do that because i would be leaving with their product uncooked,1
very complex,1
probable better,1
sour after taste my friend suspected that it was red,1
curious to find out what it was so i asked the cashier,1
perfect for a small snack on a cold day,1
rather warm,1
how stuffy,1
so much for me,1
more than happy to show you an atm that charges you 250 per transaction,1
mostly clean,1
nit pick about birdshit,1
here for the john dory,1
totally tasteless,1
totally devoid,1
fabulous food everywhere fresh,1
even palatable,1
ok ok,1
great food good but not superb,1
group dinner great,1
well sized,1
noisy cramped,1
swanky and cool,1
not pretentious,1
so warm and welcoming,1
excellent after coating them with soft butter and syrup,1
great and the,1
casual as hell in here and just,1
obvious that that the bartenders were lost,1
not paying,1
even more delightful,1
finally taste great,1
happy i did not listen to some of the reviews,1
so fresh hot and full of fantastic,1
so salty it was inedible,1
short of magical,1
pretty rare in toronto,1
busy and loud,1
fancy but much nicer,1
always crowded and overpriced,1
most attractive,1
bigger than most but a bit too big,1
right around 1230,1
able to stay anyways as the bebe was fussing,1
able to incorporate the phrase sausage fest into our brief conversations,1
limp mushy and flavorless,1
enough to almost cut the inside of my mouth,1
cold i guess,1
gone and so old that it looked shriveled up and nasty,1
great to support a small local shop,1
perfectly fluffy,1
super flavourful,1
far less hectic than the ones downtown,1
open late so it makes it easier for my schedule,1
beautiful in there,1
six year old,1
open to the public,1
very dim,1
similar to that of downtown cocktail room,1
red to reflect the color on to any drink sitting on the table,1
almost ottoman like bar,1
nice chill,1
soft as butter,1
fresh although not very flavorful,1
so glad that this little place is still open,1
absurdly priced and friendly,1
greasy and fantastic,1
great atmosphere was quirky and casual perfect to eat a load of fries,1
cozy comforting,1
eclectic but not overly so furniture,1
workable for a romantic date or a more casual dinner with friends,1
surprisingly lackluster,1
good but a little overdone,1
not to like about this place,1
edging and great,1
neither friendly or offensive,1
next to the elevator,1
sure as rain falls from the sky upon checking in i,1
delighted for free drinks,1
worth staying in that depressing place,1
less than favorable,1
much better than these sour grape ers make it sound,1
good sweet,1
grand at the tables,1
obligated to give that money right back to the house by paying 500 per bottle for alcohol,1
friendly enough while we were the only ones there,1
enough to compete for the waitresses,1
willing to spend a grand or two on bottle service skip this place,1
decent for the first hour,1
thoroughly pleased with my first visit,1
double smoked,1
friendly and wonderful,1
a little meltier than i would have liked,1
much to do about the encased poutine in the ten minutes,1
more than pleased to head back to big cheese and sample some of their many many other poutines,1
joyed there is a place for coffee in his hood other than a coffee time or the coffee machine at the laundromat,1
mega cute,1
amazingly tasty and refreshing,1
meat free,1
wrong with this cozy hangout spot,1
friendly filibertos with a salsa bar and higher prices,1
much of a surprise,1
a bit more than expected a lunch will set you back 6 9 w o a drink,1
likely out of a tray,1
quick hey go,1
wrong with a battleship,1
sure how much of a chain this place is,1
heavy with the sauce,1
usually overwhelming,1
very large in size which could be a plus for those looking for more for their money,1
baked on food on your utensils or lipstick stains on your tea,1
clean organized,1
true to the food quality,1
ok and not too sweet,1
ok for being in az and much better than papa john s dominos or pizza hut,1
soft and soggy,1
fairly new in town,1
not only clean and beautiful but also very tranquil and relaxing,1
very meticulous,1
comfortable and happy,1
equally enjoyable and well done,1
so thankful that i have finally found a place that gives their clients the exceptional service that they deserve,1
lucky enough to score a big plate of jambalaya from the sun city festival event on saturday nov 12,1
how delightfully surprising,1
elusive jamburrito truck,1
quick and easy and delicious,1
so glad i went,1
so cute and clean and modern,1
really good with diffusers and a really comfy little sitting waiting,1
really mellow with relaxing music,1
free before 430,1
really bad after eating it,1
super clean and well lit,1
amazingly crisp and perfect,1
welcome to lazy daisy s,1
those yummy looking,1
super impressive to look at,1
usual for the embassy,1
really comfortable,1
great with tons of options,1
fresh from the grill or the quick buffet line,1
super nice and cheerful,1
work bad,1
totally useless,1
not standard nor customary these days to say hello,1
good their omelettes was made to order,1
absolutely worst,1
blacker than my car,1
so mad we kind of sorta went off on them,1
mad and hungry,1
able to get the orange chicken lunch special and a drink for a little under 8,1
too plain,1
devoid of any taste at all,1
fair to rate,1
the sporting life 10k once for a banh mi sandwich after i picked up my race kit and once for a huge cheat meal,1
typical food counter experience just like other banh mi boys,1
favourite banh mi from them ringing in at 750,1
lucky to have been taken somewhere,1
interested in trying more mexican restaurants,1
three hard,1
close to the freeway,1
pretty serious,1
quite surprised at how bad it tasted,1
so glad we did loved loved loved it sad,1
thick and soft,1
so polite and sweet,1
able to smoke until 9,1
so hot i pulled away,1
pretty rammed,1
alone to party,1
heart felt,1
paper wrapped,1
super warm and friendly,1
wonderful with great warmth and humour,1
lucky enough to have dogfish 120 minute ipa on my last visit a rare and delicious treat,1
exciting without feeling hectic,1
as strong of a dr pepper taste as i was expecting,1
good enough to make me want to try them next time,1
too bad this place is kind of tucked away,1
severly understaffed,1
so happy to have such a cool place,1
pretty good if your hell bent on staying healthy and waffle house is your only option,1
at that low,1
very very poor on their part,1
knowledgeable enough to review a poutine place,1
pretty good a bit peppery,1
too tough to stick a fork into,1
no table available,1
so as the wine,1
slightly salty for my taste,1
ok too,1
very good in toronto,1
very full and satisfied,1
kind of cool but not much better than anything you could get at dunkin,1
too young too drunk,1
more dynamic dance filled,1
more delicious,1
ridiculously great,1
100 warranted,1
bad to write home about here,1
happy too,1
fresh and i had much better,1
just electric,1
just a bit too loud,1
handwritten on the chalkboards,1
many of which,1
authentic italian and awesome,1
these cheesy dishes of potato gravy goodness fall into 5 different categories traditional,1
authentic scottish,1
authentically seasoned,1
the bar nice,1
relatively comfortable,1
out of stock of everything,1
able to get the hotel shuttle to come and pick us up on the way back,1
dirty down to the dishes,1
most tender and delicious,1
very knowledgeable about everything on the menu,1
very helpful and sweet,1
more than enough for lunch,1
perfect with a great blend of seasoning,1
lacking huge,1
pleasantly full,1
slightly dry and not saucy enough,1
surprisingly slightly tough,1
soft she will but tasted more like a roti kind of style,1
quite large though well worth the price,1
generous in terms of ingredients which was unexpected,1
truly impressed,1
afraid it would not be enough food,1
lovely and light,1
hard to hear each other talk,1
delicious as was the gravy,1
not sure if it was the fries or the gravy or combination of both but was,1
very big filling,1
extremely over salty,1
even edible,1
good lrb but expensive rrb,1
close to the airport and near several dining establishments and bars,1
so noticeable,1
worst and slowest,1
a little bland at my most recent visit,1
new and exciting,1
so close to all the cool spots,1
but loud and warm,1
simple but very well executed,1
spicy roasted,1
nicely seasoned with rosemary,1
fast and effortless,1
clear from looking at the servers that they had some repeat customers,1
a lot more personable,1
so ugly that i think their designer should be shot,1
fantastic about the car wash,1
surface clean,1
exactly clean,1
always amazing,1
full for a long time,1
very disgusting,1
huge lrb 26 rrb,1
spicy shrimp appetizer wonderful,1
exactly right,1
not sure why not in love,1
more truffle,1
disgruntled and annoyed,1
careful with the beer selection,1
fast friendly and knowledgeable,1
too busy on weekends,1
great about swapping meat with veggie options,1
friendly lrb as well their veggie breakfast sandwich is delicious rrb,1
expensive 2200 for the works wash i usually pay 1700 or 1800 for the same thing other places,1
just cleaned,1
incredibly cold in there,1
uncomfortably chilly,1
cold disgusting,1
good to very good,1
plush modern,1
55 year old,1
old enough to be your dad,1
necessary to give this place just one star lrb as opposed to two rrb,1
somewhat short,1
infamous for its legendary jamburrito,1
left full and satisfied because of the cajun flavors and portions,1
721 n central,1
not as expensive or crowded as others i have been to in vegas,1
sure we had a great meal and time,1
absolutely sensational,1
practically empty on sunday night,1
early or late,1
really drunk,1
great for a nice night,1
very disappointed in our service,1
out of several of their steaks and sides,1
perfect for lunch time,1
too big for one,1
longer than usual and,1
crispy and light,1
even more blessed,1
college educated,1
so amazing i love how trish and jimmy make sure that i am satisfied with my service,1
so pretty,1
velvety and incredible,1
black and white framed,1
needless to say very annoying,1
too dark bitter and soggy,1
so fluffy,1
too full to try anything else that day,1
very glad my company chose this place for our home away from home,1
quick to order our drinks and food when we were ready,1
great at connecting with her customers,1
hard or awkward,1
fresh affordable came out fairly quick,1
busy or not,1
very unimpressed,1
cheap in this area,1
nice and thick,1
cheap or cheaper than a panda,1
only 5 at,1
well really good,1
right as well with just enough crisp but not crunchy soggy or greasy,1
great as mentioned,1
even close to comparing,1
clear of their japanese dishes,1
spacious and nice,1
dirty with rust and mold,1
busy in there,1
almost stale like,1
way too chared,1
huge and juicy,1
really cheap lrb 375 rrb,1
sure you tell them not to include them,1
cheaper than mcdonalds or even the hot dog,1
mild sweet spicy,1
impressive as hell,1
most popular in the eglinton,1
thai and chinese mostly,1
good on a summer,1
nice to know that good,1
large one,1
a lot more satisfied,1
satisfied with npl,1
super awkward,1
very commendable,1
soup or pants dropping,1
fantastic with nails,1
full of regulars who arrive an hour early at least just to get a seat at the bar,1
so lucky to be a guest with a regular,1
ready to wait regardless,1
busy and delicious,1
surprised to see that i have never had banh mi boys before,1
mostly bad,1
even for vegetarians vegans,1
soo delish,1
consistently high,1
locally sourced and carefully prepared,1
able to cut in line pay lrb 1475 rrb and be off to have our picnic,1
immediately apparent,1
sufficient but not overwhelming,1
unable to finish his,1
very impressed with the quality of the battleship,1
full for a subsequent long ish walk in the park,1
sure to try a battleship,1
wrong with a triangle battleship,1
a lot busier,1
good will probably get them again when i go back,1
hard and rubbery,1
crappy worst experience ever what was supposed to been an enjoyable evening with two graduates turned into a crappy night plain and simple do not go there if you expect decent service because you will not get it,1
ever due,1
needless to say i was skeptical,1
virtually empty yet the server was friendly and the place was clean,1
a bit high for a restaurant of this caliber,1
serious about his craft,1
fun to have a little play area for them to stay occupied,1
nice to see a place like this near yonge eglington,1
so glad that i chose this place because i got to put our evening on cruise control,1
super easy to please,1
terribly rushed,1
very aggressive,1
pretty thin and more sensitive,1
very upset that i paid an extra 10 for a relaxing spa pedicure and received a rushed pedicure and no legitimate massage,1
really awkward and uncomfortable,1
bad leaving this review,1
satisfied with the care i received especially for the price i paid,1
unbelievable that dried aged,1
cute cozy and delicious,1
so impressed by this cafe,1
kid friendly with enough space,1
quiet and soothing,1
almost enough for three people,1
the best probably not,1
very favorable,1
crispy yet juicy,1
all very modern and new,1
sad is,1
really crispy and tasty,1
visibly frustrated,1
way too dry at a different spot,1
quick and super,1
huge lrb a lot bigger than i remembered rrb,1
hot in a fresh fluffy soft bread with an incredibly juicy mix of medium sriracha,1
wonderful for someone with celiac,1
impressed by her paying more attention to here text messages than her customers,1
ready as it cost me 250 plus 300 bank fee to get money out,1
very bare,1
perfect for a neighborhood sandwich shop,1
different than any other italian restaurant i have eaten at in the city,1
tiny dimly lit with only candle light,1
uncomfortable at all,1
very sweet and friendly,1
careful not to become to attached to certain dishes,1
a little salty but still good,1
absolutely incredible very large,1
too big on desserts,1
sure it is him behind the bar,1
worse than to get cold food on a buffet,1
even ripe,1
unprofessional and not concerned about guests,1
super weird,1
one free lrb during weekdays rrb or a free,1
very cabiney woodsy,1
cute and clean,1
ever pedi,1
open until 11 pm six days of the week,1
lrb vegetarian rrb,1
disappointed that my gel polish chipped and peeled after only two weeks,1
not sure if it is their application process or the quality of their products,1
incredibly flakey,1
friendly relaxed staff and all,1
ethically raised,1
unwilling to budge on the price or correct the work,1
clear it had not been done thoroughly,1
extremely disappointing,1
amazing tasty,1
more then enough to fill us both up,1
back to the whole hotel room smelling like waffle house but not in a good maple syrup,1
very famous,1
tasty a bit,1
pricey for some people,1
sexy and classy,1
perfect for canoodling anything more,1
extremely beautiful,1
nice to see the nice atrium as i was going to the sixth floor,1
so comfortable lrb thankfully rrb,1
pleased about the fact,1
sure if i would stay here again,1
very crowded on a sunday afternoon,1
really hard to disappoint a drunk,1
legit fancy,1
extremely brown,1
cold because of the fire,1
super far up,1
very attentive with the specific color i wanted,1
great but not outstanding,1
pretty melted and too soft,1
just friendly in general,1
truly fantastic,1
next to no banana peppers in it,1
super off to me,1
sort of claustrophobic,1
so respectful and nice,1
a delicious,1
hard to believe that a place like triangle bar and grill only has 8 reviews,1
enough for some,1
happy to make me a sandwich,1
amazing and soft,1
close able,1
perfect for a family or multiple occupancy,1
super friendly and welcoming,1
a bit higher than other buffets in the few mile radius,1
able to leave china city super buffet behind after i left,1
so dirty and grimy,1
rude as heck,1
possible to chill or browse what,1
stuck blowing 20 25 across multiple trucks to not starve,1
soft fluffy and worth,1
sure i intend to lick one,1
ridiculously amused by having one,1
super exellent,1
enough on their own,1
reasonable for lunch time takeout considering this is day 2 of them being open,1
ok food with high end restaurant portion,1
the greatest,1
worse than a chain taqueria with no ambiance really bad tasting food and rude staff,1
better than taco bell,1
quiet and elegant,1
the most appealing,1
 black and blue,1
just blue,1
super cute and clean,1
nice simple very small,1
surprised at how small it was,1
a bit much for a so so martini with oreo crumbs,1
not wild,1
so blase about their job and service,1
completely void,1
huge and good,1
3 years old,1
improper clean,1
very dry and tasteless,1
brown and rich,1
pretty imaginative,1
maybe too much,1
so messy and dripping,1
clean and cheap,1
more then fair,1
wonderfully diverse,1
perfect and paired,1
the most fancy,1
2010 great,1
thrilled to find out that they would soon launch their food truck in the phoenix metro area,1
mysterious mexican cajun,1
fairly enormous and filling,1
oily and salty,1
plenty spicy without it,1
pleased with my lunchtime suggestion,1
all sound amazing,1
great right,1
all available,1
so great due to the noise,1
pretty understanding,1
a bit more than we could handle tho,1
glad i did not go here for wings,1
huge with,1
absolutely nothing better than the memories,1
happy go lucky,1
only a few unattractive,1
great after a long day,1
fine despite it being full,1
happy we were a large group because there was a lineup almost out the door last saturday at 8 pm,1
quite sophisticated and user friendly,1
happy car washing,1
expensive compared to coffee time and new town,1
glad she is done it so well,1
clean but dated,1
15 people deep,1
spacious and very clean,1
amazing in itself,1
dark so i can not wait to go in there and just fall asleep,1
thrilled to try their veggie bowl,1
pleasantly surprised at the amount of food,1
little spicy,1
perfectly spicy but not too hot as to overpower the flavor of the cabbage beans and rice,1
so glad i tried it,1
full at the end,1
small tasting,1
tender but quite salty,1
average sized,1
incredibly ripped off,1
considerably more of it,1
most decent,1
nice to have more bread,1
slightly more creamy,1
lovely and fresh tasting,1
super light,1
horrible for the price,1
quite curious as to what the 750 lrb rrb portion looks like but not curious enough to come back to check,1
slightly salty,1
modest sized,1
sorry to whoever received them after,1
interested in cake,1
wonderful about cleaning out the ashtrays regularly,1
scared of places where the bouncers only pick the pretty people,1
too partied out from the previous day night,1
good for dinner,1
better for lunch,1
thicker tastier,1
outstanding and hustling,1
blown out,1
severely damaged,1
sure they assume we gave up,1
just happy,1
so vibrant,1
greasy and good,1
nice and unexpected,1
usually pleasant,1
needless to say todays looong wash paired with a below standards wash,1
better before tnt took over,1
classy and small,1
great cozy,1
able to hear what anyone has to say,1
quite sure what to do with this information,1
very tasty delicious,1
clear enough to show that,1
just a few weeks agoi,1
too bad for me,1
outstanding making it,1
fun and interesting,1
spoiled and the drinks were great and healthy lrb green tea and carrot juice added to speciality drinks made clearly by a professional mixologist lrb mikey from harlem rrb happy hour priced was very very reasonable,1
very edgey and rich,1
about 10,1
too big but very tasty,1
credibly well to reasonable locals with young families,1
manifest political,1
intimate and great,1
willing to work with you,1
sure you order a juice lrb like pineapple juice rrb,1
ready to leave so the ayce pop was beyond pointless,1
overly complicated,1
so impressed we are now contemplating becoming jamburrito stalkers,1
present with my card,1
chinese or better,1
baked for,1
so impoverished,1
more prominent than the refreshing experience i would be looking for in a cafe its hard to feel like i am enjoying a reprieve from the hustle bustle of life,1
popular with me and my lunch clique,1
fast cheap pretty good,1
perfect for a postlunch stop when we want to kill more time before heading back to the office,1
way better than baja fresh or a place like that,1
partial to the pico de gallo,1
sure you come here to get you a battleship,1
sure to check this place out if you have not already,1
familiar with npl,1
little to no curds on it and not enough gravy to call it a poutine,1
and a bit lighter than the one on indian school which is nice,1
hard to get the bartenders attention,1
a bit more spacious,1
nicer and consistent,1
ok but not worth,1
spicy and good,1
so easy to rack up a bigger bill than if you just ordere dthe family dinner option,1
a little gross on the way,1
very dry and harder,1
very full and very happy,1
spicy pea,1
as well and good to share,1
yet very tasty,1
very friendly and fun,1
delish and fresh,1
the prices reasonable,1
absolutely wonderful and friendly,1
wonderfully long,1
open till late,1
full waxing services,1
disgusted at the treatment they received,1
very slow in taking their order,1
much for their money,1
sure they are slow in serving so that you give up and leave and do not get your moneys worth,1
completely unimpressed,1
progressively worse over the last year,1
rife with old refrigerator,1
sure the bar is a good time,1
hot at all,1
nice but not efficient,1
so hot out,1
disgusting most of the time granted after a brief negotiation she paid 400 for a total once over,1
2 expensive,1
ready to say it is better but it is definitely on par,1
very standard in selection,1
not inspiring,1
very quaint,1
wrong with the food,1
able to stay to get the detail because i had an appointment to make,1
even that great,1
about to wait another two hours for it to get done,1
so lucky i did not flip out on him,1
obvious shocked,1
quite apparent,1
long especially after the first batch of wings,1
very fussy about how my nails are cared for,1
sure everything is ok before going to the next step,1
petty at least once a month,1
open monday through saturday,1
very upset over the crap,1
less than thrilled,1
not stellar,1
bubbly and pleasant,1
a bit different than the first time,1
skeptical about having dinner here and spending the money with all the other restaurants on the strip,1
glass holding,1
completely open to the restaurant,1
surprising and especially surprising,1
red to enhance the dining,1
very excited that the sister restaurant is close to my new apartment,1
sure to become a regular if it is as good as this one,1
able to accommodate on short notice,1
fast and convenient,1
too early,1
small overpriced cold and gross,1
oily and dirty,1
cool but otherwise horrible,1
so many better,1
highly overrated overpriced,1
happy as hell to find this flavor hiding around here,1
perfect how the humble master chef manages to blend this,1
bar food with nothing outstanding,1
exceptional but ok,1
thick stick like,1
illegal in other states,1
so good you drink 4 and find yourself unable to see clearly unless you close one eye,1
strictly enforced,1
extremely crunchy and absolutely delightful,1
great for older people,1
so nice not having the only kid in a restaurant,1
delish perfect,1
pretty diverse,1
food lousy,1
surprisingly different,1
better frozen,1
very detailed,1
nice relaxing,1
definitely not fresh,1
a little loud but not obnoxious,1
enough of a selection for the kids,1
crisp so it is a very nice contrast,1
great for me,1
very rich and satisfying,1
very family friendly,1
quite minimal,1
consistant with that order,1
as for the ambiance,1
sure exactly what music they were playing,1
kind of,1
big on writing reviews,1
supportive of local businesses and restaurants,1
sure you do not want the health inspector breathing down your neck,1
almost green watered down,1
typical of chinese dishes,1
the coolest in phoenix,1
a little more poppin,1
really good all the good new songs were playing,1
good with exception of one lady who always seems to have a sour look on her face,1
about as comfortable,1
green from all the left over shampoo,1
able to ring water out of my carpets lrb after 3 whole days rrb,1
family oriented,1
very tasty from what i recall,1

sure if it would have matter if there was cheese or not,1
good enough for me,1
incredibly friendly and nice,1

definitely new,1
really hilarious,1
an not sure,1
unfinished or just bad,1
comically oversized,1
so terribly inconvenient,1
raw in spots underneath the sauce,1

super thick and puffy and almost hard to eat,1
as thin,1
somewhat ample,1
pretty soft on the bottom,1
thick enough to support,1
a lot more rich than the dough found in most shops around here,1
somewhat medium,1
super curious to try their dough cooked directly on the brick,1
able to slide a pie that large off of a peel lrb or a peel that big even existing rrb,1
pretty desirable for me,1

unable to finish it all,1
wonderful as usual,1
right off the i17 and carefree highway,1

due to the fact their greek fries are just the regular fries topped with cheese with no other seasoning,1
helpful and courteous,1
friendly professional and kind,1
still amazing still delicious still the same price,1
a little intimidating,1
close by in the states,1
ready for pick up in less than 30 min,1
so tiny in terms of portion,1
clean and presentable and cheap too,1
double to have a table cloth and to be ignored,1
better than at pasha,1
able to even flag down anyone to get some ketchup for our now cold fries,1
willing to do his job,1

taste fresh,1
crazy about the corned beef hash,1
adorable and talkative,1

worth from this,1
right thin,1
even hot or humid,1
aggressive and predatory,1
empty to show their worst side,1
hostile and threatening,1
hard working,1
very happy to find that the value the selection the service and the portions were top notch,1
bad enough to turn away,1
very embarrassing,1
perfectly good,1
aloof and disconnected,1
upset and unhappy,1
obsolete and unimportant,1
unhappy with chase i am unhappy with mazda,1
utterly lacklustre,1
very likely understaffed,1
close to the waterfront park,1
 longer than usual,1
too late at that point,1
cheesy and full,1
great and overall,1
much to say there,1
large and hearty,1
enough to come back for a second round,1
pretty sterile but brighter,1
sweet spicy,1
pretty addictive,1
finely chopped,1
better and cheaper than green pepper,1
about to close,1
how friendly,1
small and packed,1
much better than wasabi,1
very small for the price,1
a little more than what i got,1
 5 cheaper,1
very little in comparison,1
bland dry and just not satisfying,1
more recently whitby 12 years ago finding good pizza,1
tired of all the franchise brands,1
very generous on the toppings including cheese,1
basic and somewhat dated,1
fairly busy for sit down service but very busy for pick up take out service,1
excellent very meaty full,1
great to eat this on a warm day,1
very asian,1
more of a korean chinese dish but equally rich and spicy,1
very depleted i noticed a few hours later,1
so much better after replenishing with probiotics and water hydration,1
more digestive,1
i ordered a large 3 topping with wings special,1
so disappointed they did not even start making my wings,1
now cold,1
really unacceptable they did not have the wings started when while there was traffic they were not busy,1
so bad i really can not justify going out there if they can not serve hot food or get a simple order ready in reasonable time,1
damn expensive,1
ok for the price,1
pretty average for a vietnamese restaurant in the gta area,1
awesome except for one thing,1
edible after the bars closed down,1
thin but simply colossal,1
true blue,1
so grateful for their help,1
sure everyone was okay,1
empty or pretty close to it,1
a little inconvenient,1
fun to eat such an enormous slice,1
really worth trying,1
first to review the ben avery,1
the more popular of the two,1
disappointed to get out of there,1
high low,1
pretty proud of myself,1
extremely friendly and patient,1
comfortable bringing my babies there for check ups,1
ok a little dry,1
as big as the palm of the hand,1
coat check available,1
difficult to cut which was great,1
excited to come back during the summer when the weather is warmer with the patio open,1
so just glad,1
one close by,1
busy so we will probably stick to take out,1
asleep driving back from the science centre,1
fresh and amazing,1
odd about this store and this whole neighborhood,1
more genuine,1
oily with no flavor,1
more interested in texting,1
happy to answer and explain,1
so fresh so tender,1
pleasantly surprised with the prince,1
very nice if a little cramped,1
sure if it is available during the week,1
fresh well made and tasty,1
crazy pet parent,1
expensive and very fresh,1
worth a drive from across town,1
likely the best i have ever had,1
best turkish,1
curly thick,1
sure to make sure,1
here and very knowledgeable about products,1
wonderful i love love love there pistachio baklava,1
cold frozen,1
enough very busy,1
sloppy sloppy sloppy,1
superior to bamiyan,1
if in the area,1
not hot,1
unfair to compare a korean restaurant in pittsburgh with those in these cities,1
high for the quality,1
super full with a long wait,1
reminiscent of the cuisine,1
the best at this restaurant,1
more open than the other restaurants in the plaza,1
quick on their feet,1
right next to my house and so convenient,1
clearly no,1
sometimes great,1
better than the not gf kind,1
stress free,1
incredibly exciting,1
delicious affordable and convenient,1
f n stupid,1
happy and healthy,1
so freakin tasty,1
a third free,1
very difficult ethnic like curly frizzy,1
very very friendly,1
negative about the staff,1
so wonderful and super,1
fairly challenging,1
well run,1
large i liked the green beans,1
prepackaged and slightly pricier,1
pretty small though so there are only a couple tables to sit down at,1
quick filling the order,1
busy so do not show up at the dinner hour and expect to sit immediately,1
so so much,1
quick to help you or answer any questions that you might have,1
better off sighting your scopes in here rather than an indoor range for sure,1
beautifully decorated,1
hesitant to walk in,1
better than green pepper,1
smaller than before at least,1
super good very specific,1
slower than average,1
much to see,1
big yummy and good,1
fine she was professional and friendly,1
so something a bit bolder than normal,1
unhappy with any aspect,1
ever or even worth,1
really excited to try their sandwiches based on all of the positive reviews,1
cautious on sunny days,1
soft on the inside,1
better than bamiyan s,1
able to finish half of it,1
good setting up appt,1
sure i find an appointment that fits my schedule or some sort of fee off of the service for me to come back at a later more inconvenient time,1
up to their management,1
ready they,1
really that friendly,1
spoiled by all the other sushi places i eat att,1
just regular,1
the best we have had but ok,1
knowledgeable about the menu,1
absolutely amazing and made in house,1
made in house,1
very tender and juicy,1
longer than necessary,1
clean and very nice,1
clean friendly and very,1
wrong with shannon,1
so unassuming,1
courteous and attentive,1
loosely packed,1
a bit too chewy,1
a bit alarming,1
chewy as heck,1
memorable except for the mound of rice beneath it,1
much better but still slow,1
all better than food court fare,1
much nicer with good portions,1
much more skilled,1
damn delicious and cheap to boot,1
too slow,1
retro cute,1
cool to see how they do the bead hair extensions for volume,1
so polite love love love poki point,1
right up the street from our house,1
perfectly pink throughout,1
quite nervous,1
impressed and more than pleased,1
liquid with some chunks settled at the bottom,1
obvious by their location which is at the amc theatres plaza,1
about 15 smaller,1
upset about their shrimp tempura,1
fair at all only sushi place,1
a little bit low,1
fantastic turkish,1
incredibly thrilled,1
so very warm and hospitable,1
tired of their approach of taking your animal in the back and then sending their assistant with an estimate of different approaches in which to care for your animals,1
sure about the differences between the courses of treatment,1
about fun at work,1
considerate of your customers time team members,1
pricey for the low quality,1
paid out by the insurance,1
very calm and happy to be in her presence,1
completely professional,1
thorough to explain both the problem and different ways to solve it,1
a small little restaurant and always busy,1
most shameful,1
a little bigger inside so they could sit more people at once,1
helpful in picking out what to add to my bowl,1
terrible did they put,1
an excess of something cloyingly sweet and sticky that is completely foreign to all my banh,1
mushy and tasteless,1
spongy and cold,1
high nor low,1
left and half,1
too dry to fix,1
knowledgeable and personable,1
dry and not very flavorful,1
so incredibly happy that this opened on my side of town,1
any higher,1
a bit too thick,1
very helpful showing me how to operate the card reader and very welcoming,1
rather big,1
overly greasey,1
sooo huge,1
great to stop in for a quick bite,1
strictly japanese,1
tasty and chewy,1
delicious green,1
somewhat modern quiet and intimate,1
typical of any ayce place mon thurs dinner 2099,1
ok atmosphere is like a small town diner without boothes,1
usually bustling,1
richly layered in terms of flavor and texture,1
creamy from coconut milk,1
enough of that perfectly cooked not yet disintegrating brisket drowned in an abundance of liquid gold the curry gravy,1
bigger with the rooftop pool,1
generally packed in here on the winter days because the restaurant suddenly accommodates less people,1
fortunate to spot the hotels owner charles khabouth just walking around checking how the crowd is at the restaurant,1

all too bad,1
efficient and courteous,1
overwhelmingly huge,1
amazing sounding,1
fancy like,1
very conservative,1
right at no cost to you,1
open til 5,1
shrewd pretentious,1
american style,1
great very clean and friendly,1
ok but definitely not worth 2795,1
pretty dry on top and the plates,1
not so much for the decorating and interior of the place which honestly is not all that hot but because the food is just delicious,1
perfect from presentation,1
amazed at all of the unique pancakes,1
nice not very special and easy on the eyes,1
double for subway,1
everything s fresh and delicious,1
usually standard,1
very thankful for ben avery,1

clear understandable,1
right in the middle of an outdoor big box mall wedged between a strip of franchise restaurant eateries and a cineplex movie theatre,1
spicy maki roll lrb combo rrb and the teriyaki,1
clean with cool japanese inspired art on the ceilings and walls,1
dry and stale,1
really sure that i would like to eat if i knew what was on the plate so it is not often that we go out seeking sushi,1
different while they do have a focus on sushi,1
standard japanese,1
the soy saturated,1
glass like,1
completely different but well worth,1
plate almost too much,1
free to ask them about the dishes,1
quite a strip mall find,1
sure about something,1
super oily left a trail of oil on my rice,1
nice to see the vegetarian option,1
very small and tough,1
apparently underway,1

right behind the range,1
busy for sunday breakfast,1
incredibly friendly and prompt,1

here hungry lrb huge portions rrb,1
comparable to the other poke places that have been popping up in the valley,1
busy on a sunday noon,1
hungry after i finished it,1
good but not as good as it should be for the location and price,1
so more than your typical fast food joint,1
totally sure that they did a deep cond treatment,1
busy close to dinner hours,1
excited to finally make it there,1
super clean bright and open,1
rather clever,1
somewhat of a disappointment,1
very good first,1
too very clean,1
cheap out on the stuffing,1
ready for sell on the counter,1
very smart,1
cool to see a vietnamese business thriving and doing so honestly and willingly,1
huge on breakfast sweets,1
cool to try something different besides your typical chocolate chip or blueberry hotcakes,1
perfect on a chilly winter morning for breakfast,1
significantly more expensive than chain pizza,1
 extra or double,1
tired of gta chain pizza where the sauce and cheese are applied with a spray gun,1
a lot cheaper than travelling to new york or chicago,1
great after eating 5 wings i could only eat a peice and a half i was so full,1
bitter tasting,1
big and fresh,1
denser and less,1
crisp than the french baguettes i have had at other banh,1
the small sandwich more filling,1
reminiscent of starbuck s volume filler trick,1
new to lebanese food,1
more noisy that usual,1
able to charge your laptop while studying is limited,1
sarcastic and condescending,1
common among shooters for the last 100 years,1
dial up,1

modern and traditional,1
not needed,1
phenomenal on working with my needs and financing,1

the better pho restaurants in the upper regions of richmond,1
quite efficient as they do want you out of the store as soon as possible,1
paranoid of,1
authentic turkish,1
a little bit too expensive,1
friendly do not expect that as compared to other starbucks in the area here,1
pretty excited to find out about poki point,1

disappointed with some of this restaurants,1
able to bring them here anytime soon for our monthly socials,1
new and improved,1
yet sweet funny,1
able to guide me to making sure i take at least a 10 strain proabotic daily lrb which my expensive one at home was only 8 rrb and to also suggest adding some other tools from herbally grounded that i was not familiar with,1
clear out a week of your life,1
aware this is a life commitment not a flush and back up with mcdeath type of program,1
too hard to find,1
definitely potential in their other foods,1
sure you try other dishes too,1
even worse at makeup,1
worse than horrible,1
pretty bummed,1
as great as before,1
hate feeling wrong,1
casual but interesting,1
quick tasty,1
other than their curry,1
more than enough variety,1
a bit higher than we are used to however,1
a tad lower 1 stick for over 4 bux seems a bit much,1
really special to comment on their salad offering might opt out on the salad on the next visit,1
kebab wise,1
lrb better than the steak i had at milestones a week ago rrb,1
35 small and really loud,1
super watered down,1
popular with students hipsters business peeps families and tourist,1
pretty sure that the music playing in the restaurant comes from the waitress s ipod which i am totally ok with,1
rather hard,1
mediocre in general,1
totally nervous,1
amazing amazing amazing,1
better than pizza sola lrb and pizza sola was a good pizza rrb,1
clean and aesthetically pleasing,1

open after the bars,1
greek and korean,1
quick and to the point,1
not uncommon to see a group of 2 3 with their tables,1
full of,1
a little runny,1
crispy delicious,1
expensive for the amount and quality of the meats,1
large enough to share with a small group,1
yummy but overpriced for a chain,1
cool but very safety and regulation conscious,1
incredibly expensive for the portions mediocre presentation even less so with taste and downright appalling service,1
better off going to canoe same view better service better food,1
generous without being overbearing at least for the short stack,1
surprised to find that the sales and service were very poor,1
very very disappointed with the experience,1
able to do exactly what i wanted in 45 minutes,1
casual and small,1
little more oily,1
tasty spicier than the other curry dish we ordered,1
tasty mixed with the curry,1
par for what korean food is,1
a bit pricey for the food in my opinion,1
extremely allergic to milk,1
right and used,1
enough to follow directions,1
enough for 4 folks,1
better than it arriving cold,1
even rolled,1
appetizing or appealing,1
able to find elsewhere,1
de rigueur at a full service place,1
notable at a place,1
very large and welcoming,1
available at the main check,1

solid and sensible,1
fun and not scary,1
very dry and undercooked,1
nice but food and service was below par,1
very overrated,1
impressive as coconut,1
prepared at your table on a gas grill that is actually built into the table,1
good for sharing with friends family,1
very impressed with this sandwich shop,1
better than any,1
professional and well designed,1
professional and well organized that it makes you think it,1
knowledgable and easy,1
understandable for being ayce,1
larger than 4,1
very first colonic,1
so welcoming warm personable and knowledgeable,1
so glad i came here instead of a center closer to my home,1
as awkward as this experience could be,1
overly priced,1
excited to see what we paid for,1
how pretentious and judgemental,1
so disappointed in the staff,1
more than most people can eat in one sitting,1
a bit cozy,1
huge their slices were but also how sort of lacking in awesomeness of flavor they were,1
right in the swing of things on the southside,1
big in quantity,1
worth huge,1
chewy in a good way,1
familiar with my posts,1
delish in every possible way,1
grateful white,1
entirely too loud for the small space of the restaurant,1

able to get us an appointment for the next day,1
close to running out,1
very rude and disrespectful,1
very fancy and coulerful,1

already healthy,1
understandably nervous,1
healthier and lighter to say the least,1
expensive in general,1
seriously overpriced,1
very accommodating and nice enough to move us to the area we initially requested,1
open at this time,1
most beautiful on a sunny day with its exposure,1
a little surprised with the side of carrots,1
ratty and not elegant,1
able to actually see my hair because she never even gave me a mirror to check out the back of my hair lrb issue 4 rrb,1
nice to get paid extra to be a boss manager etc,1
sure i have had a better slice anywhere else in my travels around the globe,1
glad to have this small chain represented here in pittsburgh,1
shocked to see a stocked market bakery and industrial pita machine in the back,1
so rare,1
so dank,1
disappointed they do not have the rose sushi,1
average but not outstanding and memorable,1
much closer to how much korean cuisine costs in bigger cities with sizable korean communities,1
cold salty,1
hard to finish as it was a large serving,1
super delicious and full,1
nice and runny,1
perfect for piercing over the rice,1
alright very turkish,1
overpriced considering quality and the quantity,1
average and pricey,1
not oily,1
tender and very flavorful,1

a little disappointed in a few things no juice or tea,1
very satisfied after the meal,1
very attentive and polite,1
so accommodating found a spot i could put my boxes,1
super friendly as well and outgoing,1
too much because the place seemed more,1
impressed it was up to par to chinese counterparts,1
abit annoying considering we were a big group trying to catch up as much as possible,1
chewy and flavorless,1
almost completely dry,1
gooey from sitting in the sauce making for an inconsistent and undesirable texture,1
sweetish and watery,1
grossly understaffed,1
very unimpressed with the quality of food and service we received at korea garden,1
quite inflated we could have had a solid meal at the hot pot place up the street for equal or less than what i paid for this meal,1
very impressed with the food,1
fantastic and much bigger,1
fair for a restaurant a little higher than typically found at a chain delivery store,1
not too thin nor too thick or stodgy,1
stingily laid,1
friendly not too intrusive but aware,1
much better at bamiyan,1
mad at us,1
few dishes from here and there across south east,1
just more expensive that those poke bowl place in tempe,1
very busy during the weekends and evenings,1
extremely impressed with their food,1
a little reluctant,1
very crowded during peak hours lrb recommend making a reservation if you go with larger crowds rrb,1
decent for the amount of food,1
really pleased,1
very honest cool,1
nonthreatening and polite,1
very impressed on how that was set up,1

downright cranky,1
colonic at healing waters,1
so calming friendly and informative,1
ready to order for our mains,1
tiny for 30,1
far too much,1
way too thick,1

so nice and extremely helpful,1
so impressed by the customer service,1
the first lrb and best,1
full of unexpected surprises,1
privileged to be given a look behind the scenes thanks to the tour otherwise i reckon most folks walking in would only see the store butchers and a glimpse of the fresh in house pita making behind the glass windows,1
starbucks overpriced,1
great to go on your own or with a group,1
a lot spicier than the other,1
juicy and tender,1
fairly heterogeneous,1
really flavorful,1
quite fast,1
attentive on the water refills and the order process,1
nice japanese,1

happy that i was referred to osaka,1
a brand new,1
safe to be on the roads,1
out of our hands,1
full as she tried to apologize for the lack of service,1
marked used on the 17th,1
unexpected little,1
lrb 50 cents rrb although this is not much,1
credit card only,1
bad enough that they do not take credit cards,1
money grabbing,1
more than other places,1
really authentic,1
annoyed at all the,1
concerned with what i wanted but rather getting me out her chair as soon,1
persoanlly all,1
much better than they did,1
famous for its banh mi sandwich which costs around 350 on average,1
quite good despite the low price,1
much pricier than the sandwiches,1
very close to this place,1
very simple in what they offer you,1
more of a pita from central phoenix than driving out to mesa,1
damn entertaining,1
highly republican and xenophobic,1
due to summer fire,1
so extremely rude that i ended up canceling the ones i made,1
nice helpful,1
nervous and timid,1

uncertain as to what was on the menu for us today,1
familiar with the process,1
a bit colder,1
sure they will get better with time,1
korean and hardly any american,1
distant and pricey,1
quite traditional and authentic,1
cardboard like in texture,1
comparable to what i consider to be lower quality diners lrb denny s and eat n park rrb,1
amish made,1
desperate for your space to enjoy the time and meal there,1
dirt cheap for such great combos,1
about fresh squeezed,1
ready to go remember,1
good about yourself,1
safe for families,1
extremely uneasy about going to this vet,1
completely ridiculous,1
bothered to have customers,1
nicer fast,1
fast great,1
empty and devoid,1
bland to the point of tasting stale,1
glad to find some korean food in pittsburgh,1
serviced despite arriving early nice head massage,1

very very awesome,1
very happy to see how much my family enjoyed what i have done in the service,1
pretty flavorful,1
considerate to ask if i had any other related food allergies,1
super sweet of him,1
better than most greek salads,1
thrilled to watch the suns game on the flat screen that hung from the wall along with the beautiful photos of greece,1
too small and always packed,1
else to offer in this east,1
proud to call osaka my own,1
clearly understaffed,1
very fresh consistent and great,1
similar to a spider roll,1
overly saturated in soy sauce but rather tossed lightly in their teriyaki sauce,1
inconvenient for so many people,1
worth the visit,1
clean and open,1
large and extensive,1
large and a bit soggy,1
too soggy wet,1
flavorful and perfect,1

grateful that their business is in exsistence,1
new in town went there based on recommendation to celebrate my birthday with some friends,1
tastier but not mexican,1
okay for when you are craving korean food and do not want to cook at home,1
overly decorated with gawdy trinkets well lit and more typical of family run places,1
long awaited,1
fair to pay for an all you can eat meal when we only ate edamame and avocado salad,1
only one,1

willing to advertise so falsely imaging what other lies,1
willing to tell just to make a couple extra bucks,1

professional friendly,1
pushy or focused,1
a bit smaller but not bad,1
5 6 years old,1
surprised at the service considering the fact that there were many familiar faces,1
bland and clumpy and clearly placed under a broiler,1
overpriced yes they are large but 5 6 years ago they were much bigger for around the same price,1

all relatively simple and classic but very very good,1
crunchy without being hard and still soft in the middle,1

probably worth,1
clean and trendy,1
right next to it,1
rare for this area,1
somewhat boring,1
not dry,1
enough to be my favorite meal,1
more than quality,1
yet classy and beautiful,1
better in food quality and service,1
out of salmon skin handrolls,1
boring and stale,1
miserable and unfriendly,1
indicative to staff of a needed change in customer service standards then its no wonder the buffet,1
that much of a deal,1
deep fried and greasy,1
so good to me and my family,1
quick to give answers and a load of useful information,1
decent but not great,1
perfect for those who like mexican like food but not the full flavors of real mexican food,1
a little bit too light,1
similar to springrolls comfy chairs and good food for good prices but the service,1
hard to get a server s attention because she does not look at you even when you stare at her to get her to take your order,1
sure people enjoy that dish but it just was not for us,1
similar to other lower quality ayce places,1
more expensive than other places,1
just as much,1

overjoyed since i miss vietnamese desserts like che from bambu back home in san jose,1
other than that it was okay,1
a bit steeper than usual about a dollar more,1
good to see something familiar as it is hard to find places such as bambu out here,1
better if they used an unscented table cleaner instead of the chlorox smelling kind they used,1
unpleasant while eating,1
as busy as he gets he will always find time for me,1
reasonably priced and good tasting,1
higher than those el cheapo chinese joints,1
mind blowing just good and dependable,1
nice to see them using higher quality takeout containers,1
true with the honey bar,1
way too confusing for me,1
able to order the spicy garlic chicken stir fry and then swap out the spicy sauce for a nonspicy one,1
able to swap out the noodles for rice at no additional charge,1
able to pay,1
nice enough to clean my table for me,1
helpful to get the prices available before looking at that tablet,1
too big but definitely worthwhile,1
able to all have our pedicures at the same time,1
great with nail art,1
really good and different,1
spicier than their breakfast sausage but less spicier,1
happy that i finally found it,1
thick and arched,1
a little harsh,1
extremely upset and extremely disappointed,1
a little tacky,1
better than my first,1

sus in my book,1
self ordering,1
excited to try this place since i have heard good things about it,1

right down the st from our new home,1
happy to be wrong,1
pleased with the menu offering hibachi meals bento boxes and of course sushi,1
less adventurous,1

compelled to write a review,1
enough to compensate for the poor service we received,1
so basic,1
left to eat,1
available to take our payment,1
about ready to just walk out,1
ultimately not worth,1

fiercely loyal to my nyc area stylist,1
afraid of taking a risk on someone new locally,1
